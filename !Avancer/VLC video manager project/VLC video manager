"""
vlc project
the objective is to control vlc with cmd using python
then it is to wire folder management with python
we would need to figure out the timing at which a video playing on vlc is at 
and we would need to figure out renaming documents on the c:\\drive
we could then write {timecode} - NameOfVid and then if the video is finished or within 30 sec of finishing
renaming it _NameOfVid

that's it for now further objectives would include having a ui folder crawler and video manager :)
