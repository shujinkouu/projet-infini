leading to https://github.com/apilayer/freegeoip#readme
then to https://ipstack.com/
then to https://pypi.org/project/ipstack/

geo_lookup = GeoLookup("05df1e122c86354f1850d220d8bbb400")

#05df1e122c86354f1850d220d8bbb400 is my access key I registered it over from ipstack.com

location = get_lookup.get_location("github.com")

#Here github.com can be replaced by any ip adress or any site

print(location)
