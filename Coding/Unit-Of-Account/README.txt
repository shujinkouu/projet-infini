so this is Unit of Account precedingly and roughly named Weed-App
The idea unabstracted is:
-buy the weed
-consider it a product worth something
-it is then not an item you have to be consumed but an item in your 'store'
-then the idea is that when you want to consume it the item needs to be bought first
-this insures that when the item is fully consumed the money is back in the bank

so here is how it works
the user gets asked the type of what is stored
so the user gets asked for the price of the given quantity and said quantity
then user gets asked for the quantity withdrawn, the program spits back the price of the quantity withdrawn
further capability of the app is to save the price of said quantity with the date and an extrapolation function which spits out average expenditure per time period assuming linear rates.

The idea is to abstract this to do it for other stuff than weed we do have the capability of wiring it onto anything so far

This is now running in a phone, this can be tremondeously expanded upon some organization will be neeeded!
