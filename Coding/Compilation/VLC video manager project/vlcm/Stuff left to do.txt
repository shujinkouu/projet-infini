so here is the stuff not yet coded, take the timecode {hh.mm.ss} and extract hh.mm.ss

multiply in a way to make it ms again so
total = HH + MM + SS * 1000 
HH = hh * 3600
MM = mm * 60
SS = ss

then use that to set_time(ms)

this will enable us to go back to the timecode we already have the engine to change the name to the new timecode
we need to find a way to grab current timecode by using get_time() instead of get_lenght()

we also need to get rid of the {.0.0} format maybe with a bit of code that feel the location of the first . and if it happens on
the 0 spot it simply removes it. timecodewithout. = timecode[timecode.indeof("."):]

a last step is to figure out if we are done so if lenght = the current time or near it then the timecode and the - should be removed
and replaced by _
