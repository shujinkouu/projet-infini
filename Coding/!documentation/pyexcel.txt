pyexcel now works here how

>>> sheet.save_as("C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\Blog article\\ressources\\coin and metal prices.ods")
>>> sheet = pyexcel.get_sheet(file_name='C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\Blog article\\ressources\\coin and metal prices.ods')
>>> sheet['A1']='bonjour'
>>> sheet.save_as("C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\Blog article\\ressources\\coin and metal prices.ods")
>>> sheet = pyexcel.get_sheet(file_name='C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\Blog article\\ressources\\coin and metal prices.ods')
>>> sheet['A1']='ceci marche til'
>>> sheet.save_as("C:\\Users\\Asus\\Desktop\\Blog article\\ressources\\coin and metal prices.ods")
>>>

yet it still doesn't keep the formating next will be that !

I started doing the spreadsheet and all, a new problem as appeared the script kills any function present in the sheet
therefore info will have to be dumped in a separate .ods file and imported in the file we are using !
