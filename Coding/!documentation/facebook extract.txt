'they' -> this ponzi is coming crashing and fast. "They" can't lower the rent without going bankrupt. "They" have bankruptcy coming from all sides. If you don't have debt buying a plot and building and farming is the way full stop. Also "they" becomes you at the point you're there so don't foster ill feeling toward classes of people, they built useless skyscraper and are stuck with them now. Let's all make life better through our work !!
