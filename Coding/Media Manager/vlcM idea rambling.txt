Ok I met V2 he feels the string modification way is ineficient

we thought I could strip the thumbnail from youtube with pytube and put it on the video
as thumbnail for the .mp4 file, so when we are there we can just include new information in the thumbnail
like color code of three hexadecimal color that can input as many information as we want in there and it can be as large
or as little as we wantnce there we can also encode information like category little symbols ect..

that would mean storing info in hexadecimal

000000

0-15 
0123456789abcdef

(15**6)**3
1.477.891.880.035.400.390.625
