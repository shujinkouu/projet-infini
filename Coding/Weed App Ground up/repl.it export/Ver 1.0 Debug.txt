I'll be starting a string collection here since it will be needed later:

In Function (a,b,c) for weed version
#String: \nYou\'re smoking
in c = input() for weed version
#String:  many grams are you\nsmoking?\n
'''
'''
Keywords for weed should be kept out of the string for testing for as long as this is in dev stage since it allows us to use any string for any means not only weed, also weed is not yes broadly normalize and therefore someone reading weed could get the wrong impression.


This is the three variable this function takes when it it used for weed.
a = what you paid ; b = how many gram you bought ; c = how much you're smoking in grams ; this function return how much the weed you're smoking cost
'''


#This is a unit conversion function it takes a price and b unit as well as c unit and tells you the price of c which should be a fraction of b. So this output the corresponding fraction of a.
def Function(a,b,c):
  c = (a / b) * c
#this code rounds c to 2 digit after the .
  c = round(c, 2)

  print('\nSpending :', c, '$')
#String: \nYou\'re smoking


#those are fixed value for a and b
#how much you paid
a=20
#quantity bought
b=3.5
c=float(input('How much weight ?\n'))
#String:  many grams are you\nsmoking?\n


#calling my function
Function(a,b,c)


#This is just a piece of code for testing purposes to know if the code successfully ran
#print('\n\n\nSucessfully ran')
