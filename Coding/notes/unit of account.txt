this will be able to be transformed into the final weedapp repo
we just need to orguanize the old stuff 
most of the stuff we can get rid off it just need to be well organize to continue on a fresh basis
we do have all the old stuff to extract from repl.it
then we do have a working prototype we can import here and we then can start deving from there

kivy now doesn't work it is required to work to be able to work on this !
pytz seems to also not be working this will also need to be figured out
