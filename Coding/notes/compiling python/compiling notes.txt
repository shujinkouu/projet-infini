the compilation process has been fully figured out, yet it needs to be orguanized and explained here!

to build .apk we use Oracle VM to create a Ubuntu virtual machine, we wire the VM to our wifi and main drive to transfer files
then we transfer our package we wish to compile, after installing buildozer we go in the directory using the terminal.
Then
buildozer init
buildozer -v android debug
here we are it is supposed to build after a waiting period if it don't you did something wrong somewhere try compile something easier 
to see if it works

for this section we building .apk we now only need to add links and further explication for specifics !

for building .exe file it is easier 
use pip install pyinstaller to get the module
then go to the directory of the package you want to compile then pyinstaller the_name.py
