>>> def post():
...     print(a)
...
>>> a = 'boop'
>>> post()
boop

a wasn't passed to post yet it was able to access it ! 

a function can access a general variable from inside itself, the opposite isn't true
if a variable is set inside a function it lives only inside a function
to make it a general variable one would have to use return inside the function to return a variable and save it
like one would save a general variable normally ex:

---------
def t():
    a = 't'
    return a

a = t()
---------
