we have a bug when typing i in the services when first using (no database)
it ask us for a password for instagram and the email and then crashes
there is a = missing in the email instagram in the database

new bug 4_11_2022 

repro step
'your services:tifgl'
crashes, seems to be to the linkedin inclusion since it works without it
correction it has to do with the order in which the credential are oredered in the database, this is probably linked with the way instagram interacts with it too
instagram seems to be broken
twitter doesn't recognize my password as the correct one
and facebook seems to be broken as well
