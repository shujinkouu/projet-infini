first we get the key

checks if services are already selected in the database, those are unencrypted informations if hey don't exist the user gets prompted for them else the service is returned under the variable named service
service = checkservice()

credential_list = []
#uses key and services as input for the function named fishfromdt() to go ahead and search for the credential file and put the encrypted credential in the list 
credential_list = fishfromdt(key, service)
#unfolds the list in it's composant by declaring them as general variable

#this uses the credential_list as an input to check if any credential is saved as None if they are they and are selected as a service then the user gets prompted for the missing credentials
