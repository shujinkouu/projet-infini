so we have 6 variables per service two for temporary unencrypted credentials two for general encrypted credentials and two for general unencrypted credentials

list
instagram, linkedin, twitter, facebook, gab

credential lists:
uncrypted
gab_pass ,gab_email ,twitter_email ,twitter_pass ,facebook_email ,facebook_pass ,insta_email , insta_pass, linkedin_email
unencrypted these are derived from decryptall():
emailgab,passwordgab,email,password,emailtwitter,passwordtwitter,emailinsta,passwordinsta,linkedinemail,linkedinpass
created by logcredentialsindt() these are temporary and exist only in logcredentialsindt():
email_gab,pass_gab,email_twitter,pass_twitter,email_facebook,pass_facebook,email_insta,pass_insta,email_linkedin,pass_linkedin

to add services all those list have to be altered 

in further version I'd like to get those unencrypted credentials temporary like the first set.

Other thing if we head that way,
the key is held for the entire duration of the session. Using it, one can decrypt any encrypted messages. the key is derived from the password
and the password is generated as a precondition to run the app.

There is no way to ask for the password as a precondition to run the app yet not hold the key during thee whole duration of the app.
is this statement right ?
probably not, there are ways we can get deeper and hide the key once generated or hide the held password and generate the key on use, either way a big risk in this app is to be found in this area.
