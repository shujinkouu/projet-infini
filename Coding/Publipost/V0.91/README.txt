Bug:
When first executing for instagram it crashes. It works the second time tho.
step to reproduce:
1. delete database
2. execute, select instagram, see it crash after you enter your logins

as of 7_26_2021:
this is working succesfully for the 4 services we are doing
linkedin gab twitter and facebook
twitter is having some problems right now and will need some hamering down !



"""this is old news
the goal right now is minimalism

prototype has been built from this version 
now we are looking for yes minimalism
a branch should be done from here so we can 
work on instagram being part of the app while we can work on minimizing the thing and simplifying the functions and failsafe already in place
