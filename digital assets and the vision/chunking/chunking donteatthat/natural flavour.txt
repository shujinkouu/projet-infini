The FDA doesn’t require food labels to say what’s in their “natural flavor”

blueberry: welp I wanted to figure out blueberry seems like this gonna go deeper.

there seems to be no direct way to figure out any specific flavour for sure the FDA website should be the whole discussion here specifically the section about natural flavour.

I think a rant about the fda standard here seems to be appropriate since I can't dig further without hitting a blurry wall put there by them!
