we should figure out how we created the pong game compiled app, then epurate it until it's empty
then test for a hello world button app then simply add the feature one by one then build slowly making
sure all step build correctly

-so first thing is geting back the pong app
-then building it once more for practice
-then epurating it
-then building the pure version "hello world"
