ok so when we press we can do stuff which is great.

ok so when I press x I should be able to:

if keyboard.is_pressed('')

skip and go back 5 sec (keybind is arrow keys left right)
drop and augment the volume (keybind is arrow keys up down)
play and pause (keybind is space)



We need to modify the rename function
so it will first check if a _ is present if it is there do nothing
then check if a timecode is already present {hh-mm-ss}
if it is there nuke the old timecode and replace it with a new one
comment should now be put into [] brackets to avoid problems.

code hunt:
