Ok picking for dave is interesting we started down the entrance block which we will call block 1 some huge trees there 12-15 bucket very possible
in a single tree, we started on the completely outter row on the left side looking from the top in a spot where there was only a 4 tree row.
we picked the two last tree of this mini row the first day.
then we started in the block to the right looking from the top which we will call block 2 to the right from the top 2-3 row you skip then it's there.
we picked for a day there then we moved to block tree which is down de lane to the right from the entrance until after the house we started from there which is
probably the end of the block we started from the top whilst otter picker started from the bottom.
