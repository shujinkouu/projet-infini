ok so a long time later is here then different things I'm working on
reseting the work equipment at the end of each day
getting some paper plastified for moral boosting purposes
these papers are the enjoy your stay paper we leave in the room
I took back those with thanks messages and want to plastify them.

We have a new member of the team, Brett I'm still trying to figure out how to make him
use his eyes and see what the job entails. Today I heard peterson says something about empathy
and it clicked with this specific problem, I should stop helping him a bunch to make the stuff easier for him
even if sink or float isn't easy or fun I think he should figurne it out with the least amount of help possible.

Something else is that I'm probably gonna become adj. to the manager so he can take breaks lots of additionnal responsibility 
but we'll do it !

I talked to Ismail my manager about extreme ownership and the concept of discipline = freedom he told me he was interested in reading the
book I therefor bought them they are gonna be here by friday.

I need to bring my defects list to Ismail so we can enter it in the system

Chain of command shouldn't be skipped under most reason for acountability reasons, use your brain!

I can now record idea while working using my phone this shouldn't be abused

my plan would be to wake up super early on work days and use my after work time to build my projects up, focus up bocko!
