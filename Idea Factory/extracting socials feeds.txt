so I think I wrote that somewhere else before
to have multiple account which are saturated
then we'd need to find a way to extract those feeds from the accounts 
the we can put them on a list as button you can click to scroll different feeds
this would totally defeat the algorithm allowing one to scroll many different personalized fields
instead of one personalized field, one could choose the subject of each feed by tweaking with the account
this would easily blow out most biases and echo bubbles out there
would be saved offline and encrypted for private scrolling
