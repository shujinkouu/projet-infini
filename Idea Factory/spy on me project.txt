So the idea is simple make a simple telemetry app which use all the telemetry available and save all the data in a database

the app is simple, a black button, spy on me.
all the data is recorded for the user, a popup could appear after set time to prompt the user to check the database
the idea is to render the user capable of observing all the telemetry I have available with simple authorization
everything would be offline and never connect to the internet, the data would be the user's and the user alone.

we could also encrypt the database.
