the idea is to treat the thing so seriously, capitalism
using the saying all work deserve salary,
we can conclude that such form of raddical capitalism would involve
paying our friend and spouses and children for basic work they would do anyway #(under some threat usually)
this would have two advantantages.
The first one, someone will want to do the dishes and the prep and the cooking
the second one, even if one doesn't have the time or the interest to do those things an habit of 
spending to get rid of it, is already present under such circomstances and the capital has already proven to be available
thus outsourcing becomes easier.

to accomplish this payment should be made either in a decent denomination of the country under one lives or equivalent pay 
in inflation resistant assets (such as gold and silver coins) or other assets.

This process can also be internalized and flipped on it's head say I consider doing the dishes valuable 
I clean them and I get the skill and the practice of cleaning them well and faster this is worth something
and is kinda bargained with the future similarly as to a credit card, no liquidity tho but I get something now
that will enable me to generate more capital later on.

This system would leverage this and pay the person what the activity is worth to promote the development of those skills,
which interns are worth way more than the mere pay one gets out of them.
