the idea is to treat the thing so seriously, capitalism
using the saying all work deserve salary,
we can conclude that such form of raddical capitalism would involve
paying our friend and spouses and children for basic ass work they would do anyway (under some threat hihihi)
this would have two advantantages.
The first one, someone will want to do the dishes and the prep and the cooking always
the second one, even if no one has the time or the interest to do those things an habit of 
spending to get rid of it is already there and the capital has already proven to be available
thus outsourcing becomes easier.

This process can also be internalized and flipped on it's head say I consider doing the dishes valuable 
I clean them and I get the skill and the practice of cleaning them well and faster this is worth something
and is kinda bargained with the future similarly as to a credit card, no liquidity tho but I get something now
that will enable me to enerate more capital later on.
