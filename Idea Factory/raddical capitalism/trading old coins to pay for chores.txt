The idea here is to enable each other to pay other people for chores they accomplish. This is useful because chores are 
something that needs to be executed for our commun interest. 

For that we need a medium of exchange that will represent real value and willingness to work for the said value
we tought about using nickel coins, we thought about using silver coins

according to current calculation to pay a 5$ chores 86 nickel in nickel would have to be used way more dime or quarter
for what is of the metal value
86 coins is still a bit much to pay for a chore it could be use to complete another coin with more value tho and is 46%
profit when found as compared as the coins face value. it is backed by nickel too not fiat

after some math I'm concluding that we could pay each other with silver coins 10 cent dimes as well as 5 cent in nickel to complete the change
for a 5$ task it would be two dime 18 nickel for example, for a 6$ one it would be 3 dime 7 nickel ect. ect.
we now only need a in the middle value like a 1$ valued coin.

after investigating the pre 2012 1$ it was worth 10cent in metal value slightly better than the nickel but not yet worth enough

2$ value can be assumed to be around 2.5$
1$ value can be assumed to be around 2$
25 cents value can be assumed to be around 0.50cent
10 cents value can be assumed to be around 0.25cent
5 cents value can be assumed to be around 0.10cent

therefore 5 cent in nickel = 0.25cent
10 cents in nickel = 0.50 cent
25 cents in nickel = 1$

chores pricing:

cleaning tables 1$
cleaning dishes 5$
doing the bed 
cleaning clothes 2$
folding clothes 3$
