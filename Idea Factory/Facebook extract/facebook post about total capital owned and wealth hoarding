The thing is that it's total capital that matters. therefore you gotta hoard wealth, that's what I am doing and everyone should too instead of buying an extra croissant I buy silver. Billionaire are just on another level of the same game. The actual angle of this post is the problem there is lot of stuff I could talk to about tangentially to this post but none will actually connect. To me this is propaganda or in newspeak sensibilization against "the rich".

I will clarify the position as it wasn't clear to me at the start either. It's total capital that matter. If you have 1k$ and your rent is 500$ that's 50% of your total capital that is absolutely huge and will have it's toll on your buying power and general living experience. if you have 10k$ your rent is still 500$ that's 5% of your total capital little bit less of a sting but still ouch 100k$ means rent is now 0.5%. The more you go the less stress you'll feel as stress is your brain calculating the trajectory and that 50% has a huge trajectory impact.

to illustrate the point here's the saying, anything that cost 0.1% of your total capital is basically free (this statement assume you make some sort of money from having that money and that this gain beats the 0.1% it's more general a heuristic but it illustrate the point). There is no harm done by said practice. More people gotta start doing what the rich people do so normal people will have an appreciation of the tools at our disposal, of what is legit and of what is not. We'll I want to talk about tax deduction now since this is the real problem and probably what this unironically marxist meme probably is very poorly referrencing and there is deffinitely "equity" problems on that front (quotes for avoiding the equality of outcome croud who REDEFINED MY TERM and furthermore without asking me)
