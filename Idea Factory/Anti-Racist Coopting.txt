The Anti-Racist Initiative

Okay so here is the mission statement

To Co-Op the Anti-Racist Movement and agenda, one could argue that those are
white supremacist goals and agenda, the real goal and real agenda is to teach real life skills
that are immediately applicable to reality such as fixing bikes and fixing computers as well as
coding to black people and native people but also everyone because black lives matter, native lives
matter but most importantly all lives matter. So in the goal and pursuit of making our community better
and stronger this movement is entirely dedicated to teaching black and colored people tech and mecanical
skills for a better future together, but also and most importantly teaching those people mastery and
therefore how to teach back. Because true mastery necessit being able to transmit and explain to someone
else a skill in a way that they can teach it to someone else.
