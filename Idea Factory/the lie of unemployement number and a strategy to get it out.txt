the lie of unemployement number and a strategy to get it out

unemployment number don't reflect reality that's a fact
it is meant to be an approximation
and is made reliable the same way money is 
trust in governement we trust the employment number
it's belief, faith

this number is calculated based on people who are
subscribed to some unemployment list
that's the way the number is created
the numerator is the lenght of the list
the denominator is the number of person total

that's why it's always so low even when 60% of your friends are unemployed,
most of them are not on the list

to reveal the truth simply sign up for the list when you are unemployed
the number is gonna grow pretty large when there are waves of unemployment and
that day the official figure will reflect material reality
