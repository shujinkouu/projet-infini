So the idea would be to get old phone such as the lg g5 with it's good camera and root them to customize them and remove 
every bit software which we cannot control and lock it down so it is safe to communicate with and hard to steal information from it
the idea would be to test it and to regorously lock it down to outsiders for the sake of the users privacy rights.

Firt we need to buy a lg g5 to build ourselves a prototype once the prototype done we can bring it to marc-antoine who is gonna help us to 
market it to interested audience and maybe even help us distribute it nd sell it.
