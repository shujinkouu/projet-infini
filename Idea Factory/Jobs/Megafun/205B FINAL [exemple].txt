TIMETI
uh ahaha 

MARINA
What are you doing with that thingamagic?

YANN
sigh It’s not a thing magic, it’s an electromagnetic buoy…

MARINA
nelectromagnekit?

YANN
Magnetic… its like a big magnet, but it also emits waves. With this, I’m going to attract fish… Here, watch!

MARINA
Wow! Can I have a go? 

YANN
Yeah, of course, you just have to…uh?

TIMETI
Ahh

YANN
Timeti! 

YANN
Timéti!

IMETI
Yann…? uh Have you come to save me? Because, uh… I’m standing on the bottom…

YANN
oh haha Heey! This looks like… a shark bite…

YANN
It’s my fault, my buoy must have attracted sharks… I’m sorry, Timeti.

TIMETI
Don’t worry, it’s just a surfboard

PATRICK
Hmm…  Even if you did attrack them from the size of the bite marks, they were small Ma’o Mauris. They don’t usually attack humans. That’s strange…

YANN
We should go to the village. Maybe this has happened to someone else?

MAEVA
Ohh My daughter! Tapuna told me that you had been attacked by sharks!

TIMETI
Mum… it’s OK… don’t make a drama out of it!  Everything’s fine. Look…

MAEVA
A drama of out it! Sharks tried to eat my baby! I say we have to get rid of them !

PATRICK
Come on Maeva, let’s calm down… Mao Mauri never attack humans; something must be disturbing the island’s ecosystem. 

MAEVA
I say we have to chase them !

TIMETI
Mum!

PATRICK
I don't think it's a good idea. If you scare them, they'll get more aggressive…

PAPA TUANAKU
I'm sorry Patrick but.. Maeva is right… We cannot take any risks. Any volunteers?

JACK
Ouai

PAPA TUANAKU
Jack, Auru and Inapo… Guys Get the pirogues ready!

TAHURA RAMANA
You are wrong to make war on the ma’os. They are sacred animals. If we chase them for no reason the spirits will unleash their wrath…

MAEVA
Well, too bad, let them unleash their wrath! Nobody touches my baby!

AURU
Kamate, Kamate! Ha! Ha! Kamate, Kamate! Ha! Ha!

INAPO
Kamate, Kamate! Ha! Ha! Kamate, Kamate! Ha! Ha!

VILLAGER
Kamate, Kamate! Ha! Ha! Kamate, Kamate! Ha! Ha!

YANN
Listen, all we’re asking for is a little time to clear this mystery up.

PAPA TUANAKU
You have three hours: when the sun’s rays reach the central medallion the hunt will begin. Three hours. No more, no less.

PATRICK
Marina… your mission is to gain us some time. Do you think you can do that?

MARINA
mmm

PATRICK
All right now, we agree: you take a look, you see what’s going on, but if it gets dangerous, you come back at once, OK?

YANN
Yes, yes, Uncle Patrick. I know.

TIMETI
You promise me you’ll be careful?

YANN
Don’t worry, with Zoom I’ll be in no danger at all! Right Zoom?

YANN
There were lots of dead fish over there! The sharks are swarming around them… they’re very excited.

PATRICK
Hmm… that would explain their behavior. They’re victims of a feeding frenzy.

YANN
A what?

TIMETI
A what?

PATRICK
A feeding frenzy… when they have too much to eat, sharks get crazy. That would explain why they attacked you.

YANN
Bonitos, sea bream, frigate mackerel… these species live in deep water, not here!

PATRICK
They must have been carried in from the open sea by that current.

PATRICK
We should follow the trail of these dead fish. Full speed out to sea!

YANN
Go on, Zoom, you guide us!

JACK
Uhh

AURU
Urh

MARINA
They’re going to kill those sharks. We have to do something…

MARINA
Aloha, boys… Have you heard the latest? Timeti is looking for someone to go to the party with tomorrow…

AURU
Really?

INAPO
Do you know who she’s going to choose?

MARINA
She said… the strongest boy!

AURU
Well, sorry, Inapo, but that’ s me! Look!

INAPO
Pfff… is that all you can do?

AURU
haha Well done, great! A real pro… on va voir qui tiens le plus longtemps

PATRICK
The trail of fish stops here…

YANN
Zoom can sense something.

PATRICK
Be careful.

YANN
Uh

PAPA TUANAKU
Time to go!

AURU
See, I’ve got the biggest biceps!

INAPO
And I’ve got the most handsome pecs!

PAPA TUANAKU
It is time to go. The sun has just reached the medaillon. We must go. Auru, go and fetch the others.

TAHURA RAMANA
Wait, you cannot  leave just like that!

PAPA TUANAKU
Really? Why not?

TAHURA RAMANA
I must first perform a dance to appease the shark spirits. 

PAPA TUANAKU
OK Ramana, but make it short. We need to get going.

PAPA TUANAKU
Oh ye Oh yayaya Oh ye Oh yayaya

YANN
Uh Van Krook is behind all this! I saw his submarine!

PATRICK
And there’s his yacht.

VAN KROOK
Hurry, hoist that on deck.

VAN KROOK
Be careful you numbskull… the mucin! It’s worth a fortune to the laboratories! And hurry up and get rid of those fish, I can’t stand the smell.

BIFF
oui patron Hee, hee. Imagine putting jellyfish juice on your face: women will do anything to stay looking young!

PATRICK
You were right Yann. Throwing these dead fishes out of the sea, Van krook is behind all this! These idiots pertub the ecosystem and make the sharks agressive.

YANN
But why they do that!

PATRICK
They collect jellyfish mucin to make anti-wrinkle cream

YANN
We can’t let him get away with this…

VAN KROOK
Go on, hurry up! The labs want lots more… With all that money, we’ll be able to raze the village and build the hotel complex that will make me master of Maotou! Mwahahaha allez allez

RAMANA
Oh ye Oh yayaya

MAEVA
What? Are you still here?

TAHURA RAMANA
I still have to perform the dance of the sacred canoe.

PAPA TUANAKU
That’s enough, Ramana! The ceremony is over; it’s time to go hunting.

AURU
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! Ha! 

INAPO
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! Ha! 

VILLAGER
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! Ha! 

MARINA
Wait! We still have to apply the warpaint! 

INAPO
Uhh

AURU
Uhh

VILLAGER
hm

TIMETI
Ohe HEY! COME HERE!

PAPA TUNAKU
Stop! Look!
TIMETI
Ouhou

VAN KROOK
My Jellyfish! Where are my Jellyfish?!

RICO
It was the kid and his dolphin. They cut the net !

VAN KROOK
Again this nosy little brat and his cursed fish! 

BIFF
Uh… boss… I think we’ve got another problem.

VAN KROOK
Arh

VAN KROOK
Quick, hide the mucin…

VAN KROOK
arh My precious mucin!

BIFF
Do you think we’re gonna look any younger?

VAN KROOK  
ARRRGH

YANN
Ha, ha! If I were you, Van Krook, I wouldn’t hang around here. 

VAN KROOK
I will be avenged! You hear me, you little brat?

VILLAGER
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!  Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!

JACK
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!  Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!

INAPO
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!  Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!

AURU
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!  Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!

MAEVA
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!  Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!

TIMETI
Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!  Kamate! Kamate! Ha! ha!

PAPA TUANAKU
Listen up! Patrick was right, the only shark in the area it’s you Van Krook! That’s why I declare the chase over. You must leave Van Krook otherwise you'll have to deal with Mao’s wrath!

VAN KROOK
rrr Biff! Rico! It’s time to go! Hurry up you bunch of numbskulls!

JACK
What? We just let him go like that?

YANN
Don’t worry, Zoom and I have a little surprise in store for him.

BIFF
Euh patron je crois qu'on est suivis

AURU
Well, Timeti, who are you choosing to go to the party with you tomorrow? uh uh

INAPO
uh uh

TIMETI
I don’t know who told you that, but there isn’t any party planned for tomorrow.

INAPO
But… Marina us there will be a party tomorrow night… 

MARINA

PATRICK
I have the impression that somebody certainly accomplished their mission.
MARINA
uh hihihi
TIMETI
