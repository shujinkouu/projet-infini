But, I promise you! I saw one!

UNCLE PATRICK
It’s quite possible that Jack did see an iceberg. It’s a phenomenon that’s already been observed in this region.

JACK
It’s true! It was even Zoom who led me to that iceberg!

TIMETI
Wow! I’d really love to see snow one day! It never snows here!

AURU

YANN
So, can’t we stand up straight? Do you want a hand?

AURU
I’ll be fine, thanks!

AURU
Are you sure you’ll be able to carry all that back with your shrimpel arms?

YANN
I may have shrimpel arms, but at least I don’t have a jellyfish brain.

UNCLE PATRICK
Oh thanks timeti.

YANN
Timeti !Timeti! Look what I’ve brought back for you!

AURU
No! Me! Look! Look!

TIMETI
Wooow! Water! Well now, thanks, boys! You really shouldn’t have…

TIMETI
Stop! Listen… if you really want to make me happy Try to do something together and not one against the other! Because this is…! Raaah!

RADIO
DOT-DOT-DOT a ship hit a iceberg near phanao I repeat a ship hit a iceberg near phanao

UNCLE PATRICK
I don’t believe it! Yann! Yann! Wake up!

YANN
Huh ?! What’s happening?

UNCLE PATRICK
Hurry! There’s not a second to lose!

TIMETI
Uh… where are you going? Why are you in such a hurry?

YANN
A ship has hit the iceberg! We’re going to the rescue!
                              
TIMETI                                      Oh it's terrible !

TIMETI
Go ahead and take care ! 
                              
YANN
Don't worry! Zoom is with us...

AURU
I’m coming with you!

UNCLE PATRICK
Oh good , reinforcements! We won’t  refuse that ! We’ll attach you to the dinghy !

TIMETI
hmm

UNCLE PATRICK
Uh

AURU
Uh… Don’t tell me that it’s Van Krook we have to help I hope? 

YANN
uncle patrick we’re not going to help are we? 

UNCLE PATRICK
The code of the sea is sacred, Yann! When a sailor needs help, you must go to his rescue!

AURU
You can keep your code! Van Krook and his ancestors have always brought harm to my village! I’ll never help him. I’m going home!

UNCLE PATRICK
Well, It’s your choice, Auru… I can’t make you help him! What about you, Yann?

YANN
Huh… Ok, I’ll help.

RICO
Aargh! How do you work this thing!

BIFF
Push all the buttons at the same time! Sometimes that works!

VAN KROOK
Well? Is the pump working yet?

BIFF
Uh, Rick doesn’t know how to start it.

RICO
And you do, I suppose?

VAN KROOK
Aargh, you numbskulls! It’s not that complicated to start a pump! Out of the way!

VAN KROOK
Right… the first thing to do is… hm ? …is to, uh… find the manual.

VAN KROOK
Ah! Uh… does either of you read Japanese?

VAN KROOK
Right… We have no choice… We have to launch a distress rocket!

BIFF
Me! Me! That I can do!

VAN KROOK
What a full! You have to light it first!

RICO
That was the last one! We’re going to sink for sure! We have to abandon ship!

VAN KROOK
No way are we abandoning my ship with all its priceless treasures!

VAN KROOK
Start pumping! 

UNCLE PATRICK
Ahoy! Don’t worry Van Krook, we’ve come to help you!

VAN KROOK
Toooh! This is all we needed…

VAN KROOK
You can go and play with your dolphin. My crew is managing very well by itself. Biff? Rick?

VAN KROOK
Oooh ?! Come aboard and do what you have to do ! But you’d better not scratch the paintwork on my yacht!

UNCLE PATRICK
Uhh I imagine you must have a bilge pump?

VAN KROOK
In the engine… but it’s a little… capricious.

UNCLE PATRICK
Yann, go and see if you can start it while I repair the breach. Van Krook, show me where your old tub is taking on water!

YANN
I'll do!

VAN KROOK
Uh here 

UNCLE PATRICK
Let's look at it, let's see what I can do. Come on. Get a move on!

VAN KROOK
Heeey! Be careful! Oooh... uhh

YANN
Gnn uh

YANN
Aargh! This thing weighs a ton!

YANN
Huh! Help! Zoom! Go and tell Uncle Patrick that I’m trapped in here!

VAN KROOK
Oh uh

AURU
Help Van Krook… Yeah right… And what next?

AURU
Huh ? Zoom? 

AURU
Hey, what are you doing ?! Stop !!

YANN
arh arh 

AURU
Yann?!!

AURU
Come on Zoom, lead me to Yann!

AURU
Yann!!!

YANN
Over here! I’m stuck !

AURU
Yann ??!!             

YANN
Here!! In the engine room! You hear me !

AURU
Yes hold on! 

YANN
Zoom ?! Auru! You came back!

AURU
Yeah-yeah ! Your fish is very convicing ! I'm here don't worry.

YANN
Urh gnn

AURU
Urh gnn

YANN
Thanks Auru ! 

AURU
Come on We have to get out now! The ship is going to sink!

YANN
But we can still prevent it sinking if we can get this pump started! Help me get it out of the water!

AURU
No way! We have to get out!

YANN
Auru come on! Don’t you think it would make Timeti happy if we do something… together?

AURU
Hehe like zoom you always have the right arguments let's go! let's stop talking and push

PATRICK
And there we go! The boat is saved.

VAN KROOK
I don’t understand why you’re doing this. I won’t change my plans for Maotou, you know!

UNCLE PATRICK
You’ll be able to go on looting the island and ruining the seabed, so are you happy?

AURU
Yeehaa! hahaha It’s working!

YANN
We did it!

AURU
We did it!

UNCLE PATRICK
Farewell Van Krook I just hope that one day your heart won’t be quite so cold as that iceberg.

VAN KROOK
Uhh

UNCLE PATRICK
You were incredible, boys! Without you, the ship would have sunk! Bravo!

TIMETI
You see when you try you can achieve great things together! hmm uh moua 

YANN
hihi

AURU
hihi Yes, well, if I hadn’t been there…

YANN
Ahah! Don’t forget that you basically abandoned us!

AURU
OK, Shrimpo, I bet that you can’t swim back out to the iceberg!

YANN
Oh yeah?

YANN
Follow me if you can!

AURU
Heeeeey ! you cheater

YANN
Instead of complaining try to get to my level

AURU
No problem

YANN
You're dreaming, don't act smart I'm just behind

TIMETI
And here they go again! didn't last long 

MARINA
Yep. That’s what we call boys!
