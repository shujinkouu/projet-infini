YANN
FASTER ZOOM!

YANN
Prepare for take-ooooooof!

YANN
Yaaahoooooooo!!!! 

YANN
Gnah Ha!

YANN
And a perfect landing! Well done, Zoom! 

YANN
You’re right, it’s time to show our little act to Timeti!

TIKI
Is that all you can offer to honour the Tupapau?

MAEVA
Hmmmm...Mmmm...

MAEVA
AAAAAAH!!! AAAAAAAH!!! Aaah!

MAEVA
The tiki is talking !

INAPO
Aaaaaaaaah! Aaah! Aaah! Aah! Aaaaaaah!

AURU
Oh no!

MAEVA
Uh

AURU
Aah...

AURU
THEY’RE HERE!

YANN
Uh… who’s THEY?

PAPA TUANAKU
The ghosts, the Tupapau have invaded Maotou. They must surely not have received sufficient offerings…

MARINA
The...The ghosts?

YANN
Ah Ah Ah, right, I get it,  you're just joking, is that it? Ghosts… uh… they don’t exist, right?

AURU
Be careful what you say, shrimp! The Tupapau get angry if you doubt their existence!

YANN
Uh… no… I’m just saying that… maybe there’s… a rational… explanation to these events?

TIMETI
You have to admit that this is not like the Tupapau…

PAPA TUANAKU
We’ll know more once these inscriptions are deciphered.

YANN
We won’t be impressing Timeti with our acrobatics today, I’m afraid.

YANN
hahaha

YANN
You’re right, we'll have more time to practice!

MARINA
I ain't afraid of you!

MARINA
I know you're there!

YANN
Marina?

MARINA
AAAAAH!!! Ah!

YANN
Don't tell me you believe in ghosts as well!

MARINA
noding

TIMETI
YANN?! YANN?!

TIMETI
Papa-Tuanaku has deciphered the inscriptions.

TIMETI
It says : "All the villagers must leave the Maotu island before the Bird Man comes, otherwise they will face the wrath of the Tupapau".

YANN
But who’s, the Bird-Man?

TIMETI
He’s the person who is the link between the ghosts and the living. Papa-Tuanaku has decreed that we must all leave the village tomorrow morning.

YANN
What?! You’re not going to run away… over this story of the Tupapau?

TIMETI
If only we could be sure they’re real… Let’s go and see Ramana, he’ll be able to help us! 

RAMANA
You did well to come and see me: I am THE expert on the Tupapau!

TIMETI
cough

YANN
cough

RAMANA
HA! HA! HA!

RAMANA
Tamania, eloha, elohi eloho ho hooooo… Tamania, eloha, elohi eloho ho hooooo…

RAMANA
Heia Heia Oooh...Eeeek!

YANN
Uh… Ramana are you all right?

RAMANA
Oh...no Tupapau on Maotou.

TIMETI
I knew it: they are not real ghosts! Ramana, you have to tell Papa-Tuanaku.

RAMANA
The word of an old man counts for nothing with a spirit that is convinced. We shall need proof.

YANN
We’re on our way!

YANN
With a sulky pout, Marina folds her arms and shakes her head, determined not to move. 

YANN
Zoom, shhh! 

YANN
We'll train later!

YANN
Huh??

YANN
Timeti, look! What if somebody pulled the coconut along by using this string?

TIMETI
I knew it !

TIMETI
This doesn’t look like a natural pigment. And the red is far too bright. It must be a paint bought commercially…

YANN
Shh...

MARINA
Hihi...

YANN
Oh, Marina, don’t tell me you’re ghost-hunting? Get back to the Galleon, righ now!

AURU
What’s going on… No, Timeti, don’t touch the messages; you’ll only make their wrath much worse!

YANN
Auru, you’re the son of the chief… you can’t abandon the village without a fight.

AURU
You cannot fight the Tupapau. Go on, go home!

YANN
We simply have to find some evidence that nobody can contest… Do you remember if this crack was on the tiki before?

TIMETI
No...It's strange...

TIMETI
Oh?!

WALKIE-TALKIE
Why do you not honour the Tupapau? We demand offerings!

YANN
Now for the offerings, on the menu we have coconut fritters and mango or chicken fafa with onion sauce.Will that be to go or to eat in?

WALKIE-TALKIE
Uh… wait a second… 

BIFF
To go or to eat in?

RICO
Oooh they found the walkie-talkie, you numbskull! I’ll go and get it back! Meet me at the Fanaho rocks! Get the boat started!

TIMETI
Here’s our evidence, those Tupapau really are fakes!

TIMETI
Yahooo!!! hahaha.

RICO
YAAAAAAH!!!!

TIMETI
AAAAH!!!

YANN
AAAAH!!!

RICO
YAAAAAAH!!! YAAAAH!! YAAAH!!!

RICO
Doooomed! You're all doooomed!

RICO
Kookooorroocookooo!!!

YANN
Well… have you ever seen a messenger from the Tupapau driving a dinghy ?

YANN
You delay the villagers’ departure… I’ll try to find out more about this!

RICO
Pfff! It’s so hot in this thing!

VAN KROOK
Hahaha Congratulations gentlemen. For once you seem to have done a good job!

YANN
Van Krook…

VAN KROOK
No walkie-talkie, no paint, no proof!

VAN KROOK

VAN KROOK
Soon, thanks to our dear Tupapau! Hahaha, I will finally get Maotu back ! My ancestors' island...

BIFF
Your ancestors' island?...

VAN KROOK
I've told you a thousand times, they're the ones who discovered it!

BIFF
But the Polynesians were there first...weren't they?

VAN KROOK
Yeah...Well, the Van Krooks will be the last ones!

YANN
The bag!

YANN
Oh no, it' going to the bottom...

YANN
Great, Zoom!

YANN
And here’s the evidence they painted those inscriptions.

YANN
Well, I’ve got a plan too… and I’m going to need everybody’s help.

VAN KROOK
I’ve finally got rid of those cursed villagers! 

VAN KROOK
Finally, Maotu's mine! Prepare the dinghy!

VAN KROOK

VAN KROOK

VAN KROOK

YANN

YANN
Bye, bye, Van Krook!

MAEVA
And they thought they could fool us, hee, hee, hee, but they were the ones who fell for it.

AURU
of course, I always knew that they were fake Tupapau! Hee, hee!

AURU
WOAAAAAAAH!

YANN
Oooh, I'm sorry! I didn’t mean to frighten you!

AURU 
No, you didn't! I just pretended, not to offend the Real tupapau!

PAPA TUANAKU
Anyway...

PAPA TUANAKU
Thanks again for your help, Yann. You saved the village!

TIMETI
And bravo for your super acrobatics show!  

YANN
Hmmm...

AURU
Hey! What about me! Don't I deserve a kiss? I still helped the village to get rid of Van Krook!

MARINA
And Raoul helped us too!!

THE VILLAGERS
I deserve a kiss too, I did hold the torch! / No you didn't !....hahaha
