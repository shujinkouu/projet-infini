AURU
Tomorrow is the Night of the Tupapaus, the biggest festival of the year.

YANN
Is that the sacred conch that starts the ceremony?

AURU
Yep! By blowing into it, we invite the tupapaus, the spirits of our ancestors, to come celebrate with us! We need what we need!

TIMETI
Well done, Marina! You're making great progress.

MARINA
Thanks !

PATRICK
She's been rehearsing her dance steps every night for a month! So I bet that I could stand in for her!

MAEVA
I'd love to see that ! Who's hungry?

MARINA
Meeee!

TIMETI
Meeee!

PAPA TUANAKU
Meeee!

AURU
Meeee!

YANN
Meeee!

TAPUNA
Uh your fish is heavenly as usual, Maeva.

MAEVA
There's still a ton for tomorrow's party.

MARINA
Well, I just can't wait to have the party!

TIMETI
You know, it's not just a party. It's also a way of paying homage to our ancestors.

AURU
Yeah it's this special night when the tupapaus come and bite the toes of little girls! Ouuh!

MARINA
oh uhuh Eek, But tupapaus aren’t nice ghosts ?

YANN
Are you crazy? Of course, they're nice ghosts.

AURU
Of couuuurse, well……apart maybe from Toahere ! 

TAPUNA
Oooh

PAPA TUANAKU
Ooohh

MAEVA
uuuh

TIMETI
Auru ! rrr !

YANN
What's happening?

PAPA TUANAKU
Auru, you should have never spoken that taboo name! Especially on the eve of the Night of the Tupapaus...

AURU
Sorry, Dad… It… it just popped out.

YANN
Who is this Toah...

TIMETI
uhh, uhh... Shhhh! She's a tormented soul that haunts Maotou whenever she hears her name. It must never be spoken.

MARINA
Eeek! Yann, I'm scared!

YANN
Good going!! Now she'll have nightmares because of your ghost stories!

TIMETI
They're not ghosts, they're spirits!

YANN
Yeah, well, same thing.

PATRICK
Ahem well, goodness, look how late it is. We should be off, children. We need to be fresh for tomorrow's festival. huhuhu

PAPA TUANAKU
hm if there still is a festival.

AURU
Uuhh!

PATRICK
oh

YANN
Aah ! What ? What's happening?

AURU
You gotta help me, Shrimp! It's a disaster and it's all my fault!!!

YANN
What happened here?

PAPA TUANAKU
She whose name may not be spoken" has destroyed Maeva's fish and stolen the sacred conch!

AURU
I'm so sorry, Dad...

YANN
Well, there must be some explanation...

PAPA TUANAKU
She whose name may not be spoken cannot bear the Night of the Tupapaus and knows full well that the festival will be cancelled without the call of the conch.

MARINA
But? What about my dance routine?

YANN
Don't worry, we'll find some solution, Marina.

YANN
The garland! Listen, I don't know what did all this, but Zoom can still track the guilty party and recover the conch!

MAEVA
What's the use? We'll have nothing for the banquet tonight.

AURU
Give me two hours and there'll be fish for all!

TIMETI
I'm coming with you!

PAPA TUANAKU
You have until sunset.

YANN
Do you see something? There over there!

AURU
And one more! Yeah !

TIMETI
Yeah !

AURU
So, do you think it's all my fault, too?

TIMETI
I'm just saying that if her name is taboo it's for a good reason.

AURU
They say that Tao… sorry, "you know who" only attacks young sailors.

TIMETI
Yes, but you have nothing to fear. She only chooses the cute ones!

AURU
Ha ! ha ! very funny.

TIMETI
hm uuh Did you hear?

AURU
Hum... It must have been the wind!

TIMETI
There!

AURU
Uuuhh It's her… It's her! Do something!

YANN
Huh? What are you doing here?

AURU
Huh ?

TIMETI
Yann !

AURU
And YOU what are you doing here?

YANN
The flower trail led us here.

AURU
Ah yeah? Well, nice work, Sherlock! But we didn't steal the coooonch... Ooh !

YANN
Auru !

TIMETI
Auru !

TIMETI
You okay! Auru you're all pale.

AURU
She... She came for me...

YANN
I don't know what it was… but that thing is taking the conch!

TIMETI
We should go see Ramana. He can tell us more about, hmm… you know who...

TIMETI
Night's falling… We don't have much time before Papa-Tuanaku cancels the ceremony.

AURU
Is it me or is this place more spooky than usual?

RAMANA
What? The taboo name was spoken?

AURU
And.. the sacred conch was kind of stolen by the tupapau in question...

YANN
We promised Papa-Tuanaku we'd bring the conch back before sunset.

TIMETI
But we need to know more about the legend of...

RAMANA
Toahere !

AURU
Uuhh

YANN
Uuhh

TIMETI
Uuhh

RAMANA
The evil is done. Speaking her name will do nothing to change the curse.

RAMANA
In the distant past, there lived a beautiful young girl named Toahere... all she wanted was to marry her beloved Tamiro, a handsome young fisherman. But the eve of their wedding fell upon a Night of the Tupapaus and was placed under the sign of the storm, the chief appointed Tamiro to bring back fish to the festivities. All night long Toahere yearned for the return of her beloved, but he never came back.. Furious at the chief and the tradition, Toahere left to seek Tamiro. Unfortunately, she was never seen again.

RAMANA
Later, other handsome young fishermen disappeared at sea at the approach of the Night of the Tupapaus. Survivors spoke of a sea monster possessed by the spirit of Toahere. And so their chief forbade the mention of the young girl's name so that she would sink into oblivion and never again haunt Maotou.

TIMETI
Then, no ritual can soothe her wrath?

RAMANA
Except the gift of what she most desires.

AURU
Uuhh

YANN
Uuhh

TIMETI
Uuhh

YANN
A husband!

AURU
What ?

AURU
You got any other bright ideas, Shrimp?

YANN
Stop whining, you'll scare off your future bride!

TIMETI
hahaha

AURU
Ahah

YANN
It looks like Zoom has found our ghost. Get ready, he'll lead it towards it! uhh hm ? What is happening Zoom?

AURU
She’s coming!

YANN
Uh 

AURU
Don't miss, guys. If I have to get married someday, I'd prefer to be alive!

AURU
Oh Uhh

TIMETI
ghh

YANN
But, it is not a tupapau... Oooh

AURU
Ahhh

YANN
gnne It’s a baby orca! The fish attracted it!

TIMETI
Yann !

YANN
Tadaaaa ! I've got it!

TIMETI
Yeah !

AURU
Yeah !

RAMANA
May your wrath quit this animal, Toahere. Rejoin your beloved beyond the ages and the oceans.

YANN
Poor thing, it must have been trapped in this plastic sheet for days. Another freighter tossing its garbage into the ocean… And to think I nearly believed in ghosts!

RAMANA
But the spirit of Toahere really did use this young orca to spoil the Night of the Tupapaus.

TIMETI
And thanks to us, she's reunited with her beloved.

AURU
I thought I was her boyfriend!

YANN
Go have her if you want ! haha

TIMETI
hahaha

RAMANA
hahaha

PAPA TUANAKU
It's time. I officially declare...

YANN
The festival can begin!

PAPA TUANAKU
The sacred conch… Thank you, Yann. But how did you manage it?

YANN
It would take too long to explain… but you can be sure there's nothing more to fear from you know who. Her curse has been lifted.

PAPA TUANAKU
O glorious ancestors! Answer our call and come celebrate with us!

MAEVA
Come on! Let’s dance.
