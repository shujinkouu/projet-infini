RAMANA
Wisdom is a gift acquired over many years and is often lacking in children.

UNCLE PATRICK
Okaaaay… So what’s going on here?

MARINA
nothing at all, Uncle Patrick. But look…  Raoul is cured. 

UNCLE PATRICK
How come? Was he sick?

MARINA
Uh… No, no… Not at all… In any case it had nothing to do with Toanui Teiva.

YANN
Urhhh

UNCLE PATRICK
Right… now I think you have something to tell me and it had better be the whole truth.

MARINA
But that is the whole truth, Uncle Patrick! I promise!

YANN
Stop, Marina, you don't know how to lie…
