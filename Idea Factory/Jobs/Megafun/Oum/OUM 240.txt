EXAMINER
Relax, Yann… Now, proceed slowly and circle that buoy there.

YANN
Yes, yes, to the right!

YANN
I mean starboard, thank you, Zoom!

EXAMINER
Cut the engine, please.

YANN
Um... hu..., well ?

YANN
I got it ! I got it!

PATRICK	
h

YANN
My skipper's license, I've got it! Thank you, Uncle Patrick, that was the coolest birthday present ever!

UNCLE PATRICK
I was sure you'd pass.

MARINA
You can drive a boat?! Then you're a real grown-up now!

UNCLE PATRICK
Now, you can drive all types of boat!

YANN
So I can take Timeti and Auru out on the Taaora?

UNCLE PATRICK
Uh well... what I mean is...

YANN
Come on, pleeease!

UNCLE PATRICK
Sorry… but no. The Taaora is a very large boat, with sophisticated electronics, not really suitable for a teenage cruise.

YANN
So, basically, I can drive any boat except yours, is that it?

UNCLE PATRICK
Listen, Yann, try to see it from my perspect...

MARINA
hm

JOHN SEBASTIAN
Any Boat! Except yours!

TIMETI	
Oh gee, you didn't get it, right?

YANN
I did!

TIMETI	
So, why that face then?

MARINA
It's Uncle Patrick, he won't lend him his boat.

YANN
I wanted to take you out on the Taaora to celebrate! I'm so bummed out!

AURU	
Come ooooon, stop whining, Shrimp. The Taaora's not the only boat in the world.

PAPA TUANAKU	
Children, children!

PAPA TUANAKU	
I need your help!

AURU	
Dad? What's the problem?

PAPA TUANAKU	
I forgot our wedding anniversary again!

YANN
Again?

TIMETI	
Again?

AURU	
Again?

PAPA TUANAKU	
Yes I know...

PAPA TUANAKU	
I need an idea for a present, right now!

MARINA
You can give her my brush, if you like!

PAPA TUANAKU	 
Oh well, actually, uh... 

MAEVA	
What about a cruise?

PAPA TUANAKU	
A cruise! Of course!  Except I don't have a boat and it's too late to rent one. We can't take a cruise in a canoe, after all! Oh what a disaster...

YANN
How'd you like a romantic cruise aboard the Taaora? I got my skipper's license this morning!

PAPA TUANAKU	
Really? ho ho ho, that's wonderful! You saved my life, young man! I'll go tell Tapuna. Uh... Your Uncle is okay with this, isn’t he ?

YANN
Uh... yes, yes, of course! Nooo problem with Uncle Patrick!

TIMETI	
Well, I for one, do not want to be around when your Uncle finds out!

YANN
If nobody tells him, he won't know! Anyway, I'll be super careful ! Marina, your lips are sealed!

MARINA
Aye, aye, Skipper!

AURU	
h laugh. I don't believe it! goody-goody Yann turns bad boy!

YANN
Save your strength, mate, because I'll need you and Timeti as crew!

AURU	
Ah, Ah, I get it: his Lordship will play Skipper while we do all the work.

TIMETI	
Stop grouching, okay? We're doing it for your parents! It's okay, Yann, count on us !

YANN
I'll go get the Taaora ready. Meet me out there!

YANN
Ooh! All right, it's just a little boat trip! hm. Tadaaaa! Welcome aboard the Taaora for your dream cruise, Lady Tapuna

TAPUNA	
Ooh! hh

JOHN SEBASTIAN
Any boat! Except yours!

UNCLE PATRICK
All right. I know I wasn't very kind to Yann. Isn't Yann with you?

MARINA
Well... uh... He stayed in the village with his friends.

UNCLE PATRICK
h

MARINA
Where are you going, Uncle Patrick?

UNCLE PATRICK
I was wrong. Yann's right: I should prove to him that I can trust him. I will lend him the Taaora!

MARINA
No, it doesn't matter!! Yann said he didn't give a hoot.

UNCLE PATRICK
He must have said that in anger. Poor boy, I feel so bad for him.

TIMETI	
Chef fish’s soup!

AURU	
h snif snif. Mm

PAPA TUANAKU	
Well, are you enjoying this my kudavu?

TAPUNA	
Is it normal to be going so slowly? We'd be moving faster in your canoe!

PAPA TUANAKU	
I…  I'll go speak to the Captain. Say, Yann, do you think we could go any faster?

YANN
Hmmm, I’m not sure ... can't push her too hard, she's a big boat, you know.

PAPA TUANAKU	
Exactly! She must have something under the hood! h laugh. Come on, son! Give the old tub some steam!

AURU	
Wooow

TAPUNA	
h shout

AURU	
Hey! did you find your license in a Fortune cookie or what?

TAPUNA	
Ooooh!

TAPUNA	
No, but look at the state of me! 

PAPA TUANAKU
Ooh

TAPUNA
My dress is ruined!

PAPA TUANAKU	
h

UNCLE PATRICK
Maeva, have you seen Yann?

MAEVA	
Well… he went off with Papa-Tuanaku and Tapuna, for their cruise.

UNCLE PATRICK
Cruise? But where?

MARINA
hh

MAEVA	
Well, on your boat! Didn't you know?

MARINA
hh

PATRICK	
Not at all! What is going on here?

MARINA
hh
 
YANN
Oh boy, what a mess! We have to clean all this up before we go home !

PAPA TUANAKU	
Tapuna's on the verge of a nervous breakdown… I have a favor to ask you, Yann… Could you head over to Hepatuiti, the motu where I proposed to her?

YANN
Sorry, Papa-Tuanaku, but we're already a long way from Maotou. It's late and there's all the cleaning up to do.

PAPA TUANAKU	
Come on, we've plenty of time, it's real close… you have to help me out here! Please!

UNCLE PATRICK
Yann? Yann? Do you read me?

YANN
Ye… yeah, Uncle Patrick, I'll call you right back! No problem, let's go to Hepatuiti

PAPA TUANAKU	
hhhh

YANN
This is a disaster! Uncle Patrick knows I took the Taaora! What do we do?

AURU	
Ha, ha, ha! What do you do, Shrimp? There's a difference?

YANN
h

UNCLE PATRICK
Yann! Yann! Come in!

MARINA
But you did say you would lend him the Taaora?

UNCLE PATRICK
No, he disobeyed me and... What’s all this? Oh no! Yann, do you read me?

TIMETI	
Don't look like that. You listened to your heart by wanting to help Papa-Tuanaku. Patrick will understand.

ZOOM
hhhhh

YANN
What's happening, Zoom? This isn't normal: this flat sea, the silence, not a bird in the sky!

PAPA TUANAKU	
hm

AURU	
hm

TAPUNA	
h

PAPA TUANAKU
What was that?

YANN
When birds fly low like that, it usually means there's a major danger! We have to turn back!

PAPA TUANAKU	
hm

YANN
What was that? Oh no!


TAPUNA
A tidal wave! Turn back!

YANN
If I turn around, I may take the wave side on… we'll capsize and then, it's all over. If I stop the boat, we'll be swept away… I… I don't know what to do!

TAPUNA
Ah Oh, well done! Wonderful present!

AURU
Do something, shrimp!

YANN
Uncle Patrick ? Do you read me?

UNCLE PATRICK
Ah, Yann, at last! I was worried sick!

YANN
There's a tidal wave heading towards us and I don't know what to do...

UNCLE PATRICK
Calm down, you have to take the wave head on and try to ride over it by giving the engines full throttle. You can do it! 

YANN
Right! It's make… or break!

YANN
Hold on tight!

YANN
Don't worry, Zoom, it's gonna be okay.

TAPUNA	
Aaaah!

PAPA TUANAKU	 
Don't worry, my darling, I'm here! hh

TIMETI
hh

TIMETI	
You did it, Yann, we're safe!

UNCLE PATRICK
Yeah!

MARINA
Yeah!

UNCLE PATRICK
We made it!

YANN
How are you all doing back there?

TAPUNA	
I've been better!

YANN
Where's Papa-Tuanaku?

AURU	
Dad?

TAPUNA	
hh. He must have fallen overboard!

YANN
Zoom, have you seen Papa-Tuanaku?

AURU	
Noooooo !

TIMETI	
hh

YANN
hh

AURU	
hh

TAPUNA	
hm

PAPA TUANAKU	
Are you an angel? You look just like my wife!

TAPUNA	
hh

PAPA TUANAKU	
hm, I'm sorry, Yann, all this was my fault! I should never have insisted on going to Hepatuiti!

TAPUNA	
What!? Was that the big surprise. Taking me to that island dump ? Well, I'm glad we didn't get there. I'd have been bored stiff! Nobody there, nowhere to sit down and you fishing all the time! h laugh

UNCLE PATRICK
Ooh! you gave us a real fright!

PAPA TUANAKU	
We had a fright too, you can't imagine how big!

TAPUNA	
Thank you, Yann, thanks to you we're not only safe and sound, but this "cruise" has reminded me how much I love my husband chief...h despite his blunders and bad temper!

AURU	
Good job Yann! You're a great skipper, mission accomplished!

TIMETI	
It seemed as if you'd been doing it all your life.

YANN
Yeah, but I hope I never have another day like today! I am wacked!

UNCLE PATRICK
Yann !

YANN
I’m sorry Uncle Patrick.

UNCLE PATRICK
I've never been quite so angry with you... and proud of you at the same time.

YANN
Does that mean I'm not getting punished?

UNCLE PATRICK
Oh you are! And I'll be even more proud of you when I see you clean up the Taaora from stem to stern!

TIMETI	
h laugh

AURU	
h laugh. Have fun !
