YANN
Yes, a weird sound…  “Bloop”. It might be a submarine’s engine! 

PATRICK
Hmmmm… that’s strange: normally submarines don’t make that sort of noise. It’s more of a… Bloooopioooobloooppiioooobooo

YANN
No, this was definitely Bloooop…

PATRICK
Blopooopiiououo blooopoiip…

YANN
Blooop. 

j-s/Yann/patrick
Bloop blopppoiiiio blooopiuup…

MARINA
hahaha

PATRICK
Ahem, ahem…  You’d better go over to the village and ask if they’ve ever heard this sound before. 

YANN
Okay !

PATRICK
Meanwhile, I’ll do some research.

J-S
Bloop bloop bloop bloop. Bloop bloop bloop bloop.

PAPA TUANAKU
I'm telling you, Yann...

PAPA TUANAKU
It’s lucky that you didn’t dive into that blue hole! You would have committed a grave error!

RAMANA
That's right ! The sound you heard was made by the goddess Tumura'Ifenua...

RAMANA
Thousands of years ago, Tumura’Ifenua held the sky to the Earth with her tentacles. When the sun came, furious at feeling she served no purpose, she retreated to hide in the ocean depths, in the blue hole that you saw. Tumura’Ifenua now lives hidden from the light, which she hates more than any other thing.

YANN
But, uh… has anyone ever seen this octopus?

PAPA TUANAKU
No, because on no account must she be disturbed. May the tikis protect us from her wrath! So leave her in peace. 

YANN
But, I…

PAPA TUANAKU
Do you hear me???

YANN
Okay...

MARINA
Brand news live from home! Yann is back but...
 
MARINA
Yann is looking sad. Has he received bad news? Or does he just have sore feet?

PATRICK
Yann! There you are! I’ve been researching: The sound you heard was a bloop, a very rare phenomenon that has only been heard once before. Its source has never been explained! It’s a real scientific mystery! 

PATRICK
Come on! Let's go back to the blue hole!

YANN
B-But...We're not allowed to ...

PATRICK
Rien ne doit entraver la marche de la science mon garcon!

MARINA
Come on, Uncle Patrick!  Give me the camera! Pleeeease!

YANN
Over there!

MARINA
Nous voila en direct du Tahora! Yann is ready to go to any lengths to know what’s going on in that big hole! Is he crazy? Is he courageous? You’ll soon find out by watching the adventures of…

MARINA
Zoom! 

MARINA
We're lucky the camera is waterproof!

PATRICK
Here, with this you can record your famous blooop…

JOHN-SEBASTIAN
Bloooobloooblooop!

PATRICK
I’m counting on you !

YANN
I will try!

PATRICK
Yann, be careful of the ocean current. Don’t take any risks!

YANN
Don't worry, I won't.                            
 
PATRICK
Are you okay ?

YANN
Yeah, I'm fine, but I lost the torch...

RAMANA
A torch! Into the eye of Tumura’Ifenua. Aye-aye-aye! Oh my, oh my ! Whatever will become of us? Tumura’Ifenua hates the light! Because of that torch, we are all in danger!

PATRICK
Come on, a fault confessed is a fault half-forgiven…

TAPUNA
Half-forgiven? Do you realise what you have done?

PAPA TUANAKU
Everybody calms down!

PAPA TUANAKU
For the safety of everyone of us, it is now forbidden to fish, to swim… and even to surf!

YANN
Attend Timeti!

AURU
Oh, good going, shrimp! 

YANN
Well, that’s it then… Everybody hates me. Enfin, faut quand meme pas exagerer, c'est qu'une pieuvre!

TIMETI
You don’t understand anything! If everybody resents you it’s because you have betrayed the village’s trust! 

YANN
Timeti!

MARINA
Yann made a mistake. Can he make amends? How? Find out in the next episode of… 

YANN
Merci Marina! Tu viens de me donner une idee avec ta camera!

YANN
Uncle Patrick, we have to go back there!

PATRICK
To the village! No, no… Wait till they’ve calmed down and we’ll go back and apologise later.

YANN
No, I mean we have to go back to the blue hole. I have to make up for my mistake by recovering the torch.

PATRICK
You nearly drowned, and that torch is right at the very bottom. Nobody can dive that deep!

john-sebastian
Nobooooody!

YANN
Aucun ete humain, mais un robot oui?

PATRICK
C'est clair!

YANN
It’s up to you now, robot! Zoom, we’re relying on you to protect it, but if you think it’s too dangerous, don’t take any risks. OK?

PATRICK
This wretched technology !

YANN
Just leave it to the pros! It’s like a video game… 

YANN
Hee, hee, it’s so easy! 

YANN
Uh oh…

PATRICK
Hola!

MARINA
Look out!

PATRICK
Straighten up! Straighten up!

YANN
You wanna play? Let’s play!

PATRICK
Watch out! for the current!

YANN
I know! I know!

MARINA
Allez petit robot, allez, allez.

PATRICK
Careful my boy!

MARINA
Don’t lose it Yann!

YANN
I'm doing the best I can!

MARINA
Atta boy, Zoom!

YANN
Huh? It’s not responding!

MARINA
Ah, pauvre robot!

PATRICK
It’s over.

YANN
Hey ! It's working again!

YANN
Ha, ha! Luckily, we have you, Zoom! We’ll follow you!

YANN
What’s that?

MARINA
It looks like octopus ink! Do you think it’s the one in the legend!

YANN
There’s only one way to find out!

PATRICK
It’s a “black smoker”, a chimney that allows the inner heat of the Earth to escape.

MARINA
It must be really hot!

YANN
That’s why Zoom couldn’t go any further.

PATRICK
In any case That explains where the bloop comes from!

YANN
What do you mean?

PATRICK
The chimney amplifies the sounds of the earth tremors beneath the surface and turns them into bloops!

MARINA
So it’s not a giant octopus then?

YANN
No ! No sign of Tumura Ifenua...

YANN
Ha, ha! No! No sign of any octopus! Here is the torch!

MARINA
Wouah t'es trop fort Yann!

YANN
Bingo! Mission accomplished! Well, who’s the king of the joystiiiiiick?

MARINA
hahaha

PATRICK
For sure it's you! But you still have to learn how to stay on a chair!

MARINA
hahaha

RAMANA
And this is how Tumura Ifenua went back to sleep for centuries and centuries!

PAPA TUANAKU
This is good, Yann… you have made up for your mistakes. You showed responsibility, you can be proud of yourself.

YANN
Thank you, Papa-Tuanaku. It’s thanks to Timeti, she opened my eyes.

AURU
Yeah, but the main thing is that we can go surfing again. Yeeehaa! Woohoo! 

CROWD
Yeeeaaah!!

YANN
Anyway, I can tell you now where that sound is coming from! You thought it was an octopus, well…

PATRICK
Yann, wait!

PATRICK
I redid my analysis three times. There hasn’t been a single underwater earth tremor for at least three years! We were wrong!

MARINA
But then where does that bloop come from?
