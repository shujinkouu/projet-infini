AURU
Oh .. wow.. wow yeah parfait elle est genial

YANN
Say Auru ,don’t you know you’d go faster on the water?

AURU
Ha, ha, very funny! I’m testing the board that I’m giving Timeti for her birthday. And what are you planning to give her?

YANN
Well, you know... …you’ll see soon enough !

AURU
One thing’s for sure is that it’ll be hard to find a better present than mine!

MARINA
yes Raoul!

YANN
Hey, what’s happening here?

PATRICK
Oh Yann right on time. We’re sorting through some old stuff.

YANN
Really? What for uncle patrick?

MARINA
For the yard sale this weekend! Do you want to help?

YANN
Maybe another day Marina, for the moment i’m the one who needs help.

MARINA
uh

PATRICK
Oh, my, you don’t look good. What's happening

YANN
It’s Timeti’s birthday and Auru has made her a super surfboard. I’m going to look stupid if I give her what I’d planned.

PATRICK
And what’s that?

YANN
This …

PATRICK
A fin fasteners? Ah, but they’re very practical and uh…

YANN
I know it’s pathetic…

PATRICK
You can find something better, I’m sure.

MARINA
Uh you can give her this!

YANN
Oh! Here, Timeti, have an old broken, dusty lantern! And why not this old book while you’re at it ? 

YANN
Hey… That looks like Timeti…Anatole Guerin, the Painter of the South Seas…

PATRICK
He was a great artist, you know. I saw one of his exhibitions when I was a student.

YANN
The book says he came to live on Maotou more than a century ago. He painted his best pictures here, including Native Girl at Sunset, which has never been found… 

YANN
Did you know that uncle Patrick?

PATRICK
I’ve heard it said, yes.

YANN
The whereabouts of Anatole Guerin remains a mystery. 

YANN
After loading his boat and bidding farewell to the inhabitants of Maotou, he is said to have disappeared near the island while rowing out to a freighter moored off shore to return to France… Nobody knows what happened to him.

YANN
And his paintings. 

YANN
Ooooh I’m going to find Native Girl at Sunset and give it to Timeti!

MARINA
I’m going to give her a painting too!

YANN
The thing is I don't know how to start.

PATRICK
Go and see Ramana. He’s the living memory of Maotou.

YANN
Ok i'll do that

YANN
See you later!

PATRICK
So then I guess I'm gonna have to do this ... 

YANN
You'll see zoom this present is gonna be the best present Timeti is ever had. 

YANN
Ramana! 

RAMANA
Yena yena...!

YANN
I’m looking for informations about Anatole Guerin. He’s a painter!

RAMANA
mmmh?

RAMANA
I know who Anatole Guerin is!

YANN
Did you know him?

YANN
I’m not as old as all that!

RAMANA
Ah… yeah, right, sorry…

YANN
So, I’m looking for where he disappeared…

YANN
In fact, I want to find one of his paintings to give to Timeti. If you help me it’ll be as if you shared in the present.

RAMANA
So, you think an old man like me can help you?

RAMANA
Well, in that case, sit down…

RAMANA
Yyya yayaa

RAMANA
My pendulum has spoken: that is where Anatole Guerin’s boat sank!

YANN
Huh? Really? 

RAMANA
My pendulum is never wrong, do you hear? 

YANN
So, his last painting must be there!

MARINA
Will you stop this? A good model does not move. 

MARINA
Hey it's not finished... Raoul come back here. 

MARINA
Raoul! I said! Come back here! 

YANN
Be patient, Zoom, an expedition like this has to be planned.

TIMETI
Hi there, Yann! 

YANN
Huh Timeti!

TIMETI
Look, this is the surfboard that Auru gave me for my birthday. He couldn’t wait to give it to me. 

TIMETI
I'm gonna test it out are you coming? 

YANN
Sorry, Timeti, but I’ve got a really urgent job to do.

TIMETI
Oh… Well… As you like… 

AURU
So, what present are you going to give her?

YANN
Do you think I’m going to tell you that?

AURU
I say he has nothing for you!

MARINA
Raoul? Come on, show yourself! 

JOHN-SEBASTIAN
Roooh ta cachette! ta cachette!

MARINA
John-Sebastian! Don't move!

MARINA
You'll be a great model
 
JOHN-SEBASTIAN
Great model! Great model!

MARINA

JOHN-SEBASTIAN

YANN

TIMETI
HAHA So perfect!

AURU
Yes, I know. What can I say ?

TIMETI

TIMETI

AURU
Ah-ah-ah...

TIMETI
Youhouuuu!

YANN

YANN

AURU
Hey, what's up big fish?!!

TIMETI
Wait Auru! I think he’s trying to tell us something!

TIMETI
It’s strange that Yann isn’t with him, don’t you think?

AURU
Yeah, maybe. I did not noticed that…

YANN
uhuh

AURU
What would you do without us, shrimp!

YANN
Thanks!

TIMETI
It’s Zoom you have to thank!

YANN
Yeah, you're definitly the best!

AURU
I don’t want to spoil the moment, but just what were you doing out here alone like this?

YANN
Inside that chest there is a masterpiece of a great painter named Anatole Guerin... It was my birthday present for you...

TIMETI
Oh, I see...

AURU
Pfffff! What a pathetic present!

YANN
In any case I must go back.

AURU
What?!!!

TIMETI
What?!!!

MARINA
Jean-Sebastien, arrete de bouger!

JOHN-SEBASTIAN
Naughty Raoul! Naughty  Raoul!

MARINA
Have you two quite finished? If you go on like this, I shall paint Flem! Come back!

TIMETI
You shouldn't have to risk your life for my birthday...

YANN
Ca depend pour qui. I'm almost there...

YANN
Oh nooo!!

YANN
The seawater has totally washed them out.

YANN
I should have known... I’m sorry, Timeti.

AURU
Hey, look!

AURU
A sunset by… what did you say? Anatole Guerin!

TIMETI
Wait a minute ! Now I know what that name reminds me off...

YANN
What, you know it?

AURU
Huh?!!

TIMETI
This painting has been in my closet ever since I was a little girl. My grandfather gave it to me. He got it from his father. 

YANN
Oh! Native Girl at Sunset by Anatole Guerin! Il est encore plus magnifique que dans mon livre!

TIMETI
Oui tres beau!

YANN
This is incredible!

AURU
If I’ve got this right, you were going to give her a painting she already had? Wow, nice work, shrimp, some gift!

TIMETI 
Ne l'écoute pas Yann, tu m'as donné envie de redécouvrir ce peintre et ça c'est merveilleux. Merci.

MARINA
Hello everybody! Are we giving presents already? 

MARINA
Then I’m going to give you mine!

MARINA
Here, choose a painting!

MARINA
Thank you, Marina. That’s so sweet of you.

TIMETI
They are all so interesting. It’s hard to choose just one.

TIMETI
It’s hard to choose just one, they’re all so… interesting.

MARINA
You can choose several if you like.

MARINA
Oh, who painted Timeti and Zoom?

YANN
Zoom? Where?

YANN
Oh my! You’re right!

AURU
It can’t be Zoom..

MARINA
That’s him!

AURU
How old would he be?

YANN
At least one hundred !

TIMETI
BAh dis-donc, je ne le pensais pas si vieux !

MARINA
Zoom ! Come back ! Hum… I think you’ve upseted him
