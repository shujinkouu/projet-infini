PAPA-TUANAKU
…I have the great honor to declare the grand annual fishing competition open. This year Maotou is competing with Hawutai, represented by my old friend, Naone.

YOUNG MEN
Yeeah ! Hawutaaaaiii ! wouhoo weee

NAONE
In other words, Hawutai! Maotou hasn't a chance of winning this year. Am I right, friends? hahaha

YOUNG VILLAGER
Yeah ! we will win !

YOUNG MEN2
Boooo

YOUNG MEN3
yohoouuu

YOUNG MEN4
Youhouuu !

PAPA-TUANAKU
Yes, well… we'll see about that. This year, it's the team led by my son, Auru, that will have the honor of adding yet another victory to Maotou's record. Everybody to your boats!

AURU
Yeahh

YANN
No sweat, buddy, we're going to win this competition!

AURU
Of course, Shrimp!

MARINA
Yeah, we're gonna win, right, Raoul?

AURU
Oh no! Not you, Marina. There's no more room in the canoe!

YANN
If she's not coming, neither am I!

AURU
Pff… All aboard, losers!

NAONE
Let's go, boys! We’ll blow ‘em away! Heh, heh!

VILLAGER
yeah yeah

AURU
Come on! Move it! Naone and the others are already out there!

UNCLE PATRICK
Yann, there you are! Did you forget we were supposed to go collect coral samples from the reef?

YANN
Aargh! I completely forgot. Sorry, Uncle Patrick, but… I'm on Auru's team for the fishing competition.

MARINA
Me too! Me too! Me too!

UNCLE PATRICK
Oh?… Okay, it's no big deal, I'll go by myself. I'm counting on you to win for our island!

YANN
Thank you, Uncle Patrick!
 
MARINA
Thank you, Uncle Patrick!

YANN
Are you sure this is the way to go?

AURU
Don't worry, Yann, I've got my rebelib! It's a traditional chart used by my ancestors. It's the most accurate there is! We'll follow the currents that carry the plankton and, therefore, the big shoals of fish!

AURU
Yeaaaaaaah! Ha, ha!  That's real fishing!  Well done, Timeti! How about you, Yann?

YANN
Well… uh…

AURU
Nothing? What, are you serious? Are you doing this deliberately or what?

YANN
Are you crazy? How can you say such a thing?

AURU
Well, then you're even more hopeless than I thought! Look, even Marina did better than you!

TIMETI
Stop arguing, it doesn't help! You're friends, aren't you?

AURU
Sure we are… well, it depends on the day.

YANN
Do you know what? You do your stupid fishing by yourself! I'm going to help Uncle Patrick. At least he really needs me.

TIMITI
Arggg

UNCLE PATRICK
I'm glad you changed your mind. I’m really going to need your help. I noticed something strange.

YANN
Something strange?

UNCLE PATRICK
Yes, I… Oh no…

YANN
Uncle Patrick, do you read me? Uncle Patrick? Uncle Patrick?! Answer me ! It’s not normal I have to locate him !

YANN
Quick, Zoom, we have to find Uncle Patrick!

J-S
YAAAANN! YAAANN! Rooo

YANN
Hey John-Sebastian! Have you seen Uncle Patrick? 

J-S
PATRIIICK! PATRIIICK!

YANN
What, you know where he is ? He must have taken the Turtle… he's on the seabed…
	
YANN
Uncle Patrick, it's Yann. Do you read me?

YANN
Quick Zoom Uncle Patrick is in danger  let's got to the village to get some help

TIMETI
At this rate, Naone's going to win the competition. Why did you get mad with Yann? He was doing his best, you know that.

AURU
I know… but it's so important to my Dad that we win this competition that…

MARINA
Yippee! I've caught a monster!

MARINA
This isn't a fish…

TIMETI
It looks like…

PAPA-TUANAKU
Don't worry, Yann. Patrick's an old seadog, he'll be back soon. You know, problems with radio contact are pretty frequent…

YANN
I'm sure it's more serious than that…  I should have been with him, I'd promised…

TIMETI
Yann, look! We found this!

YANN
What?! That’s part of Uncle Patrick’s turtle. I knew it! Something’s happened to him!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Oh my… Listen up! The competition is suspended. Try to alert Naone. We need all the canoes to look for Patrick. Don't worry, we'll find him!

YANN
Uncle Patrick disappeared on a dive. We won't find him with canoes.

TIMETI
What if we used Auru's rebelib to work back up the current the plating was drifting on?

YANN
Are you sure this is the right direction?

AURU
Of course it is! I trust my rebelib to follow a current more than I do you to catch a lousy fish!

TIMETI
Aaargh, I don't believe this! Don't start again!

TIMETI
What was that?

AURU
It sounded like an explosion.

MARINA
What’s happening ?

YANN
Oh no … the tank is empty. I was in worried, I didn’t check the fuel level! That's it… We'll never find him…

AURU
Listen shrimp … We're gonna find him, okay? I've never seen you give up. You're not starting today!

YANN
But… Huh? What are all those fish?

YANN
There are all dead, This is really weird they don’t seem to be sick and they have no injuries. 

AURU
They're being carried on the same current where we found the plating from the Turtle. That sound, like an explosion, and now this: something's happened further up!

YANN
hm!

TIMETI
hm!

AURU
That's Naone's boat!

NAONE 
Papa-Tuanaku informed me that the competition was cancelled so everybody could join in on the search.

AURU
Hmm, that must suit him. He knows he was going to lose.

TIMETI
hm hm you were saying? Looks like it suits us better. Naone was going to win hands down.

YANN
We were tracing the current back with Auru's rebelib when we found dead fish. Do you know what happened to them?

NAONE
No, no idea. But we don't need that old gadget.

YANN
I'm trusting the ancestral methods to find my uncle.

NAONE
Well, as you wish!

AURU
It's that way!

MARINA
Do you see how many they caught? What beautiful fish they are!

MARINA
Be careful Raoul ! What are those things?

YANN
Before we discovered the dead fish we heard a distant noise. It was quite loud. Didn't you hear anything?

NAONE
No, we didn't hear anything. What sort of noise was it?

YANN
That sort of noise!!

TIMETI
Marina !

YANN
Marina!! Are you okay?

MARINA
Yeah. It just scared me.

TIMETI
So that's it! You're fishing with grenades! Not only is it dangerous, but it destroys the ecosystem, the coral… and

AURU
And it's cheating!!

NAONE
It's not cheating. It's still fishing. It's just a… how can I put it? A more… modern technique, and way more efficient !

YANN
That's enough! It must have been one of your grenades that damaged the Turtle and caused Uncle Patrick's accident!

NAONE
I hope nothing serious happened to him. We made sure we were all alone, but we never imagined there might be a submarine!

YANN
There! Zoom's found something!

AURU
We'll have to hoist it up, the prop's broken.

YANN
I'll warn Naone.

NAONE
Roger, we'll send the winch down right away!

NAONE
What happened

VILLAGER
I don’t know

UNCLE PATRICK
Ahhh ahah ahh hm uh oh

TIMETI
Arrrr

YANN
Arrr

NAONE
Enough ! Let me take care of this!

AURU
Yeah! Yeah!

TIMETI
Yeah! On a reussi!

YANN
Yeah! Yeah

UNCLE PATRICK
Thanks, kids, you arrived just in time.

AURU
Not such a bad catch after all!

YANN
Well done, Zoom!

NAONE
This was all my fault. Because of my rivalry with Papa-Tuanaku I failed to see clearly. This contest was so important to me. I did everything to win and because of that I nearly created a disaster and lost a friend.

NAONE
Of course, I'll pay for the Turtle's repair and… I concede defeat in the fishing competition.

AURU
We are the champs, right, Shrimp!

NAONE
I'd understand if We were not welcome back to Maotou.

PAPA-TUANAKU
What you did was dangerous, stupid and highly irresponsible. The worst of it is that, coming from you, I'm not in the least surprised!

NAONE
I understand. Forgive me… So, farewell, my old friend.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Wait … You can come back whenever you want… …as long as you recognize the superiority of our island in every domain! Hahaha

NAONE
Yeah… Dream on! Hahaha
