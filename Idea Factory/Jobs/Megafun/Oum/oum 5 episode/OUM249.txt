AURU
Do you see him?

AURU
Yeah, pff, well, I'm past the age for playing hide-and-seek and I'm fed up! Anyway, Clarissa said she'd be stopping by Maotu soon and I don't want to miss her.

YANN
Oh, stop moaning! Well You know he just loves to play "dolphin hide-and-seek"! Oum!

YANN
uh ah Ha-ha! Tag! you’re it!

YANN
Ha, Igor! Rosie! Baby Zoom! What are you doing here?

AURU
My old buddy, Igor! How are you?

AURU
Ah ha! Looks like you found a girlfriend! You old Romeo!

YANN
Zoom, tell them to follow us to the village! They'll be amazed when they see you all!

PAPA-TUANAKU
It’s rare to see so many dolphins come so close the village! That's a good sign: dolphins have always been the protectors of our island!

UNCLE PATRICK
Hmmm… But it's curious that they should all come here in a group.

YANN
In any case, if they stay, Zoom will never feel lonely again!

MARINA
Stop it, Rosie, I already took a shower, hee, hee!

TIMETI
This gathering of dolphins, it reminds me of something… A story Ramana told me…

PAPA-TUANAKU
What story?

TIMETI
RAMANA!

TIMETI
"Gone to gather plants on the volcano"…

TIMETI
The book of prophecies…

MARINA
Huh. Aren't they playing anymore?

AURU
They got serious all of a sudden!

YANN
It's funny, it's like they're treating Zoom as their chief!

AURU
Hey, Zoom! Don't get a big head!

YANN
Timeti… Where have you been, you look weird…

TIMETI
I was thinking about this sudden appearance of the dolphins. Why are they all here? I mean, it's not just to say hi to Zoom, right?

YANN
"The Book of Prophecies"… you think you'll find an answer in there?

AURU
Maotu prophecies always come true, you should know that, you've lived here long enough.

YANN
Almost always!

TIMETI
There is a prophecy that talks about a gathering of dolphins at Maotu, but I can't decode it and Ramana isn't here. Yann, please can I use your computer? Maybe I can find something to solve this mystery?

YANN
Of course Timeti!

UNCLE PATRICK
…very well… call me back if you learn any more.

YANN
A problem?

UNCLE PATRICK
An oceanographer colleague. Several people have recorded surges in marine animal migration, which is rather odd this time of year. As if they were fleeing something.

TIMETI
Could the appearance of the dolphins at Maotu be linked to that?

UNCLE PATRICK
Maybe… Generally, dolphins group together either because they've detected a rich source of food in the area or because they fear a common danger.

YANN
"A common danger"?!

UNCLE PATRICK
Hmmm… I'll call my colleagues on Hawutai to check if they've noticed anything unusual in the region.

YANN
Take your time. I'm going to go check out the area where the dolphins joined Zoom. There may be some clues, something that might explain their presence here.

TIMETI
Okay!

VAN KROOK
No, no and no again! No way! I know that sometimes I bend the law a little, but this is going way too far!

WERNER
Ha, ha, ha! Still driving a hard bargain, eh, Van Krook? Okay, I'll double the price, just for you! And it’s done!

VAN KROOK
hmm No… Now hear me. For once it's not a question of money.

WERNER
Very well. I'll do without your services. However, there is a slight problem…

VAN KROOK
Oh yes, what's that?

WERNER
Now you know too much…

VAN KROOK
Aaah!

AURU
…come with you? Ah, sorry, Shrimp, I got a date with Clarissa, I'd hate to stand her up!

YANN
I've always admired your sense of priorities.

MARINA
They don't stop talking to each other! You know what… I wish I could speak dolphin and understand what they're saying!

YANN
What about you, Zoom, will you come with me?

YANN
Okay, you want to stay with your friends. I understand, don't worry. I'll be back soon.

CLARISSA
Hi there, Uncle. Okay, I'm off, I won't be back too la…

CLARISSA
What's going on here? Who are you?

WERNER
Go shut her in her room.

CLARISSA
Ouch, ooh, don’t touch me. I now my way! I can go by myself!! 

VAN KROOK
Don’t touch her

WERNER
I hope you won't mind lending me your sub, free of charge, naturally? With its "special" equipment, it'll be very useful to us!

CLARISSA
Uh uhh urh

AURU
Pff… What's she doing?

TIMETI
Don't worry: Clarissa's always late! You should know that by now!

AURU
Yeah, I know… how you doing with that translation?

TIMETI
Well, uh… according to this translation program, the prophecy relates that "the tiny shellfish love to eat French fries"…

AURU
Okaaaaay… sure is a weird prophecy.

TIMETI
Pff… I'll never do it. This dialect is only known to old shamans like…

RAMANA
Uh uh hmm 

AURU
…Ramana!

TIMETI
…Ramana!

RAMANA
Ohhh my book! I was looking for it everywhere! This book must never leave my hut, Timeti!

TIMETI
I'm sorry, Ramana, I was looking for information about the "dolphin prophecy"…

RAMANA
The dolphin prophecy?

TIMETI
We need to show you something…

RAMANA
On no… has the moment come?!

YANN
What are they doing out here in the middle of nowhere?

YANN
Terrence Werner…

WERNER
It's okay, you can proceed!

YANN
"Proceed"?! With what?

YANN
But he is crazy. … 

YANN
Quick! I have to warn everyone!

UNCLE PATRICK
Barrels? Were you able to see what was in them?

YANN
No time… Van Krook attacked me with his submarine! I've never seen him so determined!

UNCLE PATRICK
That crook! That cargo must be very valuable for him to go after you so hard!

YANN
Don't worry, Uncle Patrick, Van Krook has never scared me! And he's not starting now! Where are Timeti and Auru? 

UNCLE PATRICK
I don't know. Ramana came here and they all rushed off towards the village. The dolphins followed them, Zoom too…

YANN
Did you call your colleagues?

UNCLE PATRICK
Yes, they've taken samples: certain fish in the region are suffering from an unknown disease. Analysis is still going on, but I don't like the sound of it… and even worse, if Werner and Van Krook are working together it really doesn't bode well…

YANN
We have to alert Papa-Tuanaku!

PAPA-TUANAKU
What do you mean by "the signs do not deceive"?

RAMANA
This gathering was foreseen in an ancient Maotu prophecy: it is said that one day, the dolphins will come to seek aid from the white dolphin, protector of the island. He must lead them to the other seas to escape a terrible danger…

TIMETI
…So Maotu must allow its protector dolphin to leave.

YANN
That's ridiculous! Zoom would never do that!

UNCLE PATRICK
There may be some truth in that story… the dolphins have come to ask assistance from Zoom, that's clear.

AURU
Don't worry, Yann: Zoom and you are like brothers, never in this world would he leave without you!

TIMETI
Zoom is your friend, a friend of us all, but he is first a protector: if he must lead his friends, his people, to live in the open sea, you cannot go with him. You must let him leave, Yann…

YANN
Zoom cannot leave, NEVER!

MARINA
Uncle Patrick, is it true, is Zoom going to leave us?

UNCLE PATRICK
I'm afraid he is, Marina…

YANN
Let me come with you, Zoom. If there really is some danger threatening your friends we can face it together, like we always did!

AURU
My friend, you have to let him go, now…

YANN
So long, my friend, I'll never forget you, NEVER!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Farewell, Zoom, may Maotu protect you wherever you go!
