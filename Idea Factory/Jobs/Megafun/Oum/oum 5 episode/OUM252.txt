YANN
Auru?! Auru?! Auru?!!

TIMETI
Auru??

YANN
Auru! Your dad's looking for you all over since this morning! Tomorrow's the seafood festival and he wants us to put a giant clamshell in the marae for the Anga ceremony.

AURU
Seriously? A giant clamshell? Now?? Pff… I don't have the time, I've got something super important to do!

TIMETI
As you wish, but Papa-Tuanaku didn't look as if he was joking. What have you got to do that's so important?

AURU
Pff. Well, okay, but let's make it fast! So, are you coming?

TIMETI
Gnn… slow down, boys, it's not a race.

YANN
Gnn… It's Auru, he's pulling… Gnn… You'e in a big rush… what's your super important business?

AURU
Gnnn… no time… for… chatting!

TIMETI
Okay.

YANN
Oh, no!

AURU
It's fine, not even a scratch!

PAPA TUANAKU
Oh… I don't believe it! You break the pahua just before the ceremony!

PAPA-TUANAU
You will find me another one before the day's end!

AURU
But …

PAPA TUANAKU
And no “buts “!

AURU
Pff… Finding a clamshell that size will take us hours and I won't be able to make my meeting.... A meeting with my brother of the storm, there, now you know!

YANN
Your… brother of the storm? Who's that?

AURU
It's Inapo. When we were ten, we got lost at sea and stranded on a desert island. We had to support each other to survive till they found us. It was really tough…

AURU
Since then we call ourselves brothers of the storm. Every year, on this day, we meet on that island and spend the night there. It's a tradition. There's a bond between us that nobody can understand!

AURU
It's really important. And I can't even let him know because I'm stuck here. He's gone out fishing for the festival!

TIMETI
Don't worry: he has to deliver the fish to my mother. I'll wait for him at the restaurant and explain what's happened.

AURU
Really? Great! And tell him to come help us as soon as he can! He's the best fisherman there is!

MAEVA
Well, thank you Inapo! you delivered this much earlier than planned!

INAPO
I've got a really important meeting and I don't want to be late! See you, Maeva!

MAEVA
Aurevoir!

MAEVA
Ah, Timeti! Can you take over for an hour at the counter? I have work in the kitchen.

TIMETI
No problem, I have to wait around here anyway.

INAPO
This year, I'm here first!

AURU
With Inapo we'd have been done by now! He's such a good fisherman that sometimes you think he really is talking to the fish!

MARINA
Well, Yann speaks to dolphins.

AURU
There. Now we just wait for Inapo!

YANN
We don't know how long he'll be. Can't we go right now? We'll manage okay.

AURU
Ha! Ha! Are you serious, Shrimp? Without Inapo, we'll never do it!

YANN
Gnagnaga, “without Inapo.

AURU
I don't understand why he's taking so long. Okay, come on… too bad if we only have two pairs of arms to raise a thing that size, it'll be a struggle!

YANN
With Zoom, it should be okay!

AURU
Marina, go to the restaurant and tell Timeti we've gone to find the clamshell, we'll do without Inapo.

MARINA
Okay! Come on, Raoul, let's go!

MAEVA
Like to try my latest special, Marina? 

MARINA
Hmmmm!

MAEVA
It's a shrimps‘s salad!

MARINA
Oh, yeaaaah!

MARINA
Raoul! Get back here, you little schrimps thief!

TIMETI
Where did those fish come from?

MAEVA
Well, that's Inapo's catch.

TIMETI
What?? He's been here already?! But…? Oh gee!! I have to tell the boys!

INAPO
Pff… What's he doing? It's not normal…

AURU
We have to be careful, Yann. Giant clams are a protected species. We just look for an empty shell, okay? And be real careful not to swim over a live clam…

AURU
Shadows stress them and they close to protect themselves. If you get caught, you're done for!

YANN
I never knew you studied clams.

AURU
Inapo taught me all about them. He's not only a great fisherman, he's a great teacher too!

YANN
Yeah… He's a great guy. Just a pity we can't rely on him when we need him.

AURU
Hey! What is exactly your problem, here? 

YANN
Well spotted, Zoom. And just the right size!

TIMETI
Pff, they left already…  I don't believe this!

INAPO
Anybody seen Auru?

MARINA
Oh yes. He and Yann went off fishing together.

INAPO
What?! Auru can't have forgotten about our meeting! I saw him this morning! Did he leave any message for me?

MARINA
Oh, yes. I think he said he'd do without you.

INAPO
Do without…?! He really said that?

MARINA
Hmhm!

YANN
Right… Bring it up gently…

YANN
I said gently… oh no, oh no, noooooo!

YANN
I don't believe it! We have to start all over! 

TIMETI
Hey, Inapo! Auru can't come… to your meeting…

INAPO
I know, he's with Yann!

TIMETI
Yes ! That's it! Is there a problem?

INAPO
Hmmmm.

TIMETI
Hey! Inapo! Arrete de faire la tete. I'm fed up with chasing after everybody. So tell me what's going on! Right now!

AURU
Okay, Shrimp, take it away!

AURU
Yep! This'll do it!

AURU
Aaaah!

YANN
Auru!

AURU
Help!..

AURU
Ahhhh, hmphhh.

YANN
Oh no! Gaaaaaa. 

AURU
Forget it, all we can do is wait till it opens again.

YANN
But… You've only got half an hour's air left! We have to haul it to the surface with the rope!

AURU
Forget it, Yann. This pahua must weigh three times more than the other one!

MARINA
Yes, they were going to do without you, but just so they could finish quicker and Auru could meet you.

TIMETI
Ah, you see, it's all a big misunderstanding!

INAPO
A misunderstanding… easy to say that… but Auru chose his best friend a good while back… For two years now he's been spending all his time with Yann. Am I right or not?

MARINA
Aargh! Boys are so complicated!!

TIMETI
Zoom!? What's wrong? It looks like Yann and Auru are in danger.

AURU
It's no use, you're just wasting your air. I hope Zoom will get in time.

YANN
I'm sorry, Auru… I've acted like a child all day. I think I was jealous. When we first met we were sort of rivals, but now… You're… my best friend. And I'd loved to have had as   close a bond with you as you have with Inapo.

AURU
Actually, Yann… you're not a friend to me… You're a brother.

YANN
It's Inapo!

YANN
Got it! I'll take care of it!

YANN
Haa! Quick Zoom, he's out of air!

INAPO
Hurray! You… never… swim… over… a… pahua!!

AURU
Yeah… I know…

YANN
He was so eager to meet up with you that he didn't think about what he was doing…

INAPO
Really?

AURU
But, guys… You can't take me back to the village like this, uh! I look such so silly!

INAPO
You exaggerate! It’s not so bad! Hahaha

PAPA TUANAKU
This year we can once again celebrate the festival of Anga! And I must also give a big thank-you to Inapo and Yann for helping my son make up for his blunders… by the way, where are they?

INAPO
From now on, this date will forever mark our triple friendship.

AURU
A friendship of three brothers is even better than two?

YANN
It’ hot! It’s hot!    Aie, Aie …!

AURU
It’ hot! It’s hot!    Aie, Aie …!

INAPO
It’ hot! It’s hot!    Aie, Aie …!
