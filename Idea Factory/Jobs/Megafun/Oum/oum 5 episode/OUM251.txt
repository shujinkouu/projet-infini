CLARISSA
Ah! Here you are! I was looking for you over at… Uh… What's wrong with him?

TIMETI
Auru is practicing for the festival of friendship between Maotu and Hawutai, our neighboring atoll…

MARINA
…the sons of the two chiefs have to put on a show…

TIMETI
…Auru's going to demonstrate the Ori Tane, that's our traditional dance. Go on, Auru, you're the best!

MARINA
Don't you like it? I think it's really cool!

CLARISSA
Wooooow!

AURU
Yeah, I know! You ain't seen nothing yet! Here we go!

CLARISSA
Hey, who is that? He is so cute!

TIMETI
That's Keanu, the son of Naone, the chief of Hawutai.

CLARISSA
I am a fan!

YANN
Uh… So, what do I do? Do I stop?

PAPA TUANAKU
Ha, ha! My old friend! I didn't expect you so early, the festival's not till this afternoon…

NAONE
I wanted to spend some time on Maotu… it's so…exotic.

NAONE
Anyway! Have you met my son, Keanu?

PAPA TUANAKU
Of course! How are you, my boy? You look great!

KEANU
Weeeel… I'm cool.

NAONE
Ah, well, let’s have drink. How is Tapuna?

AURU
So, Clarissa, what did you think of my dancing?

CLARISSA
Yeeeah… well, uh… It was… interesting. Hey! Great! There's Keanu!

YANN  
Wooow… the flightboard from Keanu A board connected to a turbine to pump water straight into the sea! That's really smart!

KEANU
Yeah… and really expensive too. But that's no problem for my dad. He's the sole owner of three hotels on Hawutai…

CLARISSA
Oh yeaaaah? My uncle's super rich too! We have so much in common!

KEANU
Uh… I see you have a visitor. Do you wanna visit the island?

AURU
Hey, this is MY island!

KEANU
By the way, cute little dance, Ruru! 

AURU
You gotta build me a flythingy for this afternoon, Yann! No way am I going to look like a fool compared to him!

YANN
Huh?? But I don't know if I can build a machine like that, especially in such a short time…

AURU
Come on, Shrimp, you're a genius! I'm certain you can do it!

YANN
Maybe I could use the turbine from the underwater scooter… But I'll need help!

TIMETI
Not me, sorry, I've got a class with Ramana.

MARINA
Me! Me! I’d like to help you. I love inventing things!

AURU
Tsk, tsk… I've got a far more important mission for you…

KEANU
Pff… well… Maotu's cool… but, honestly, there's nothing to do here! My island's much more modern.  You can visit if you like…

KEANU   
My dad's even going to open a theme park. It‘s gonna be awesome. You hope to go ?

KEANU
Waaaaaaooooaaaah! What's that???

KEANU
Sorry, I must have, uh… pulled a muscle on my flyboard.

CLARISSA
Poor you… I bet it's really hard to fly a machine like that.

KEANU
Yes well, even more than you would think.

AURU
Yeah …!

YANN
Well played!

TIMETI
"The Prophecies of Toadama"? What's this?

RAMANA
Toadama was a very ancient shaman. He wrote hundreds of prophecies which of all so far prove to be true.

TIMETI
"When the two islands come together, the son of the First shall touch the sun then sink into the depths…"

AURU
Your flythingy is amazing. Keanu's gonna turn green with jealousy!

YANN
But you've got to learn to ride it first.

AURU
Don’t worry, I got it covered. Come on Shrimp, bring back the cable and the engine!

AURU
AAAAAAaaah! How do you stay on this thiiiiiiing!?

YANN
No, not like that! Spread your arms… No… Yes… higher.

AURU
Ahhhhhhhhh!!

KEANU
Amazing this sport! It became my new passion!

CLARISSA
Great! Mine is kite-sur. I won the last junior worldwide competition …..

MARINA
Wait, Maeva, I'll do it!

MAEVA
Oh thank you, sweetheart! With this festival, I don’t have a second.   I am overwhelmed!

MARINA
Theeere! Two cooling mango juices!

CLARISSA
Thanks sweetheart!

KEANU
Yes, so.. like I was saying.. AAAaaaah! It's burning! Sorry!  

CLARISSA
Don't worry… No problem… I was too hot anyway…

KEANU
So… What do they put in mango here??

MARINA
Aaargh, did he hypnotize her or what?! We must tell Auru.

AURU
Yeah!

YANN
Yeah! Well done, Auru! You've got the trick of it now!

AURU
Hurray! Am I good!

YANN
Sure, you’re the best!

TIMETI
Oh!! No way!

YANN
Timeti! You okay? You look really weird!

TIMETI
It's just that… I read a prophecy at Ramana's.

TIMETI
"When the two islands come together, the son of the First shall touch the sun avant de somber dans les profondeurs'. "When the two islands come together": that's today, the festival of friendship! "the son of the First": that's you, the son of the chief! "shall touch the sun", c'est ce que tu fais avec ton truc la.

YANN
Hmm… Sorry, Timeti, but… aren't you exaggerating a little bit here?

TIMETI
I don't know… Deep down, I know I'm right. Auru, I beg you, don't get on that thing…

AURU
You… you… you think so?

MARINA
Sorry, Auru. I tried everything to break them up, but it's not working! It makes me mad! Those two are like magnets! 

AURU
Grrr… Come on, Shrimp, let's go practice!

YANN
Don't worry, Timeti. I’ll keep my eye on him. And we've got Zoom, if anything goes wrong. Right, Zoom?

TIMETI
Auru’s going to hate me, but I had no choice…

UNCLE PATRICK
This is a fascinating machine… But I'm worried about any pollution it could create.

YANN
Really? You think so?

PAPA-TUANAKU
Auru! Timeti told me about your fly-thingy and the prophecy. I forbid you to step    on that thing again!

AURU
But Dad…

RAMANA
The prophecies of Toadama cannot be taken lightly. Thanks to this book, Maotu has escaped many a disaster.

NAONE
Aaargh, but if Auru wants to have fun! Are you going to allow an old shaman to influence you?

PAPA TUANAKU
Stay out of this! I don't tell you how to raise your son!

PAPA-TUANAKU
You will dance the Ori Tane as planned, and that's that! Patric, je compte sur toi pour mettre cet engin de malheur sous cle.

UNCLE PATRICK
Sorry, boys.

AURU
All this is your fault!

TIMETI
Wait! Auru!..

PAPA TUANAKU
…And so I declare the festival of friendship open! Auru, over to you! Auru?

AURU
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing!

PAPA TUANAKU
Please be patient… Auru is nearly ready, il ne va plus tarder… Where is he?

KEANU
Ha, ha, he's scared he'll look like a fool! 

PAPA TUANAKU
Auru! Get off that thing right now!

KEANU
He stole my show!

CLARISSA
Boy, he sure learned fast!

TIMETI
Oh no! The prophecy!

YANN
No, just watch, he's a real wizz, nothing's going to go wrong.

TIMETI
But Toadama is never wrong!

YANN
Wait …. What if the prophecy referred to Keanu? Toadama speaks of the son of a chief, but doesn't say which one…

AURU
Relax, Zoom, I got it!

KEANU
Move over, this is no place for amateurs like you!

AURU
Hey, get off me!

KEANU
No! You get off me!

PAPA TUANAKU
What's hapening? Where are they? I can't see them!

YANN
They're in trouble!

CLARISSA
Yann wait !

PAPA TUANAKU
AURU!

NAONE
KEANU!

TIMETI
Ouaaais!

CLARISSA
Ouaiiiis!

PAPA TUANAKU
I was so scared!

AURU
Sorry, Dad, I should have listened to you… You too, Timeti, I owe you an apology…

PAPA TUANAKU
You disobeyed me. And worst of all, you forgot this was the festival of friendship. And certainly not about beating your neighbor.

KEANU
Wait! Auru and his friends saved my life! That's the greatest proof of friendship you can show, right?

NAONE
Well said, my son!!

PAPA TUANAKU
Let's celebrate that! 

UNCLE PATRICK
At least dancing doesn't pollute and it's not dangerous!

YANN
Obviously you haven't seen the way I dance Uncle Patrick…

MARINA
So? Did you see how Auru rescued Keanu? He's cool, isn't he?

CLARISSA
Sure, Auru can be great… sometimes!

MARINA
Auru, it's okay, she likes you best! Can I stop bugging Keanu now?

AURU
Don’t be upset!. I swear you , it was for fun!
