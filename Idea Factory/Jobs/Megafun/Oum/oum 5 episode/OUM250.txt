MARINA
You have to eat, Yann, or you'll get too thin!

YANN
Thank you, but I'm not hungry, Marina…

UNCLE PATRICK
Cheer up, Yann, I understand your sorrow. Zoom's leaving makes me sad too, but it was his choice. You'll see: with time, you'll come to accept it…

YANN
I can't accept that he's gone, Uncle Patrick, I CAN'T!

UNCLE PATRICK
Leave him, Marina, I think he needs to be alone.

YANN
Uh uh uh

AURU
Hey there Yann… how are you feeling?

TIMETI
I understand.

AURU
I know how you feel too: Clarissa stood me up yesterday and… Ouch!

YANN
Clarissa didn't come?

AURU
What, what is it?

YANN
Maybe that’s… I saw something yesterday. I think the danger threatening the dolphins is connected to some dirty deal between her uncle and Werner…

TIMETI
Dirty deal?

YANN
Yes. We have to find out what they're scheming.  If it's linked to the flight of the dolphins, we’ll fix the problem and maybe they'll come back?

CLARISSA
Aaargh! Let me out of here!

CLARISSA
Ohh Heeey! Heeey! Help!

YANN
Nobody… Watch out for Van Krook! Yesterday, he got particularly aggressive with his submarine, he seemed prepared to do anything!

CLARISSA
HELP! HELP!

AURU
That's Clarissa!

CLARISSA
Uh uh

AURU
Oh hm Ou Ouch!

CLARISSA
Auru?! You okay? Oh, I'm so sorry! I don't believe it, you rescued me!

AURU
hm Yes, hmm… Don't worry, it's normal. Are you okay? It was your uncle who locked you up in here!

CLARISSA
My uncle! Are you crazy? He'd never do that!

VAN KROOK
Hey! Ohhh! Are you out of your mind?

YANN
I speak, here…  You almost killed me with your submarine what are you up to with werner. 

CLARISSA
Wait, Yann it's not what you think…

VAN KROOK
She's right, I wasn't in the submarine…

VAN KROOK
Auru, I need to talk to your father. The future of the atoll is at stake…

VAN KROOK
Hmm… well… Werner asked me to supply logistical support to dump… radioactive waste!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Radioactive waste?

MARINA
What's "radioactive waste", Uncle Patrick?

UNCLE PATRICK
It's dangerous material from nuclear plants or military installations. You must not go near it. It's the worst poison on our planet and it lasts a very long time.

UNCLE PATRICK
… usually, the authorities treat that waste. How's Werner mixed up in this?

VAN KROOK
Not all states are too fussy about nuclear waste treatment. This comes from the black market…

YANN
"Black market"?!

MARINA
That means nasty people selling horrible things for lots of money to even nastier people!

MARINA
What? I saw it in a film.

VAN KROOK
Hmm… yes, basically, that's it. Werner was paid a small fortune to get rid of it. He has probably started to dump hundreds of barrels off Maotu's coast.

YANN
It is for that reason that the dolphins start to escape…

UNCLE PATRICK
Over time, those barrels will disintegrate, the waters will then be so polluted that nothing will be left alive in the whole atoll!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Why are you telling us this now, when you always been polluting our island with your lowdown schemes?

VAN KROOK
Okay… Occasionally I cut corners with some environmental laws… But this is going too far. This ocean is my home too. And it's in grave danger.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Everybody to the canoes!

UNCLE PATRICK
Wait! We can’t attack them head on. They’ll see us coming. It’s better to take my Turtle and surprise them. Plus, it was designed to resist anything, including radiation…

VAN KROOK
…just like my sub. That's why Werner stole it!

UNCLE PATRICK
Papa-Tuanaku, alert the authorities. We'll take the Turtle and try to stop those boats.

WERNER
This area is also full, we'll again change location for the last boat!

WORKER
Look!

WERNER
What in the…

WORKERS
Ouch! Ooooh!

WORKER 2
Ha, ha! Not so much fun now, huh?

WERNER
That’s great. I know a marine park which is looking for dolphins! I think I will get a good price for it! Now, go on guys. We have more barrels to sink!

YANN
I just hope Zoom keeps clear of that waste…

TIMETI
Trust his instinct, he'll know how to spot danger…

UNCLE PATRICK
Get in, kids. We have to stop Werner!

VAN KROOK
Wait!

VAN KROOK
I can help you thwart that scoundrel… 

TIMETI
Look!

YANN
ZOOM! I can’t believe it!

YANN
Hmm… Where are the other? It looks like something's happened…

UNCLE PATRICK
There's no time to lose. Let's go!

UNCLE PATRICK
Target in sight!

YANN
Look they’ve captured the Dolphins    

VAN KROOK
It's time to test this little gadget, which cost me a small fortune.

WERNER
… we’ll dump the last barrels here!

WERNER
What's going on?

WERNER
Heeeey!

WERNER
HELP ME! BLUB! I CAN'T SWIM! Oh

VAN KROOK 
Look! It works!

UNCLE PATRICK
Let's go back up!

VAN KROOK
Ah! It's great to have my favorite toy back! Clarissa, get in with me!

CLARISSA
But, uh… I want to stay with my friends!

VAN KROOK
Van Krook to Turtle: ready to follow you! Dive!

UNCLE PATRICK
Roger.

VAN KROOK 
Immersion!

UNCLE PATRICK
Let’s wreck their engine.

VAN KROOK
I am taking care of it!

WERNER
We're under attack! Start the engine, you numbskulls!

WORKER
No engine! We checked it only yesterday!

UNCLE PATRICK
It is out of order

VAN KROOK
Don’t move.

VAN KROOK
It's time we pulled out of here… WE'RE OFF!

WERNER
Hm AAAAAAH!

UNCLE PATRICK
Good Job, Zoom!

TIMETI
Yeah! Zoom!

AURU
Yeah! Zoom!

YANN
Now, it ‘s time to pay for what you did, Werner! 

INSPECTER
Right, Werner and his men are under lock and key. We've located the radioactive barrels. They’ll be moved to a registered storage site where they won't pollute the ocean bed.

YANN
I just can’t believe that Van Krook helped us Maybe he’s not as bad as we thought.

UNCLE PATRICK
Let's hope this experience has at least taught him to show more respect for the ocean…

PAPA-TUANAKU
We thank you, O great white dolphin, for protecting your brothers and sisters and all the people of Maotu from imminent danger!

RAMANA
You have proved that fate cannot be written. By thwarting all dangers, you have silenced the prophesy.

YANN
And I thank you for choosing me as your best friend… Promise me? We'll never part again.

AURU
The Shrimp's gonna make us all cry here.

MARINA
hm

UNCLE PATRICK
uh

YANN
let's go Oum friend for life

MARINA
You're the prettiest Oum
