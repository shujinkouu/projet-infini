MARINA
Hey, Yann! Do you see? I've collected loads of wood!

YANN
That's great, Marina, keep going. I never thought a hurricane would cause so much damage, the sea's a real mess.

TIMETI
Auru! Can you help? If we don't all work together, we'll never get it done!

AURU
orhhh Yeah, yeah, easy, I'm on it! "Oh, my atoll! You're my lovely doll! If we clean your water, you'll look like you oughta!

TIMETI	
hm

YANN	
hm

FISHERMAN
Woaaah! Keep it quiet! We can't hear ourselves fish!

AURU
Pfff… You don’t know a good voice when you hear one…

INAPO
You're scaring off the few fish that aren’t already gone! We haven't caught a thing since the hurricane.

YANN	
hm ?

TIMETI	
hm ?

AURU	
hm ?

MARINA
Well, if there aren’t any fish, he must be hungry. Are you starving, Zoom? Do you want us to find you something to eat?

TIMETI
Maybe my Mom has some fish left, we should ask her.

RAMANA	
hm ?

MAEVA
Here, Zoom! A present!

UNCLE PATRICK
What's going on? Usually Zoom manages to find fish.

MARINA
The fishermen say there aren't any more fish at all!

YANN
Isn't it strange? It seems that the ocean is empty…

UNCLE PATRICK
Hmm… The hurricane was violent, but not enough to drive all the fish away! There must be some other explanation…

YANN
I'll go diving tomorrow to see if the fish haven't been hiding in the coral since the hurricane.

MARINA
Really? So we're not cleaning the sea anymore?

YANN
You can do that with Auru and Timeti, it'll be fun!

AURU
Okay, I get it: you go for a dip while we do aaaaall the work!

MARINA
Auru, please…

AURU
Okay, fiiiiine, we'll do the clean-up with the mini-shrimp…

MARINA
Yeah!!!

AURU	
hm ?! hm ?

MARINA
Yeah! Let's go!

YANN
Isn't Timeti with you?

AURU
No, she's not at the restaurant, nor is her mother. Didn't you see last night? They were talking with Ramana, they looked really weird…

YANN
No, I wasn't paying attention… But there's more urgent stuff at hand. We have to find out why the fish have disappeared. Maeva can't keep feeding Zoom forever.

YANN
hm ? hm ?! hm ? hm ? hm ?! hein ?! hU Did you see all those lionfish? There were so many! We have to tell Uncle Patrick!

AURU
Uh ? Hey See that?! What are they up to…

MARINA	
Uh ?

AURU
Hey! Where are you going?

TIMETI
Sorry, Auru, this doesn't concern you.

AURU
Huh??? No way!! Oh! I don't believe it! You see how they treat me! Hmmm… Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Cave… I wonder what they’re up to !

MARINA	
oh !

AURU
Hear that? It sounds like music…

TIMETI
"O divine Spirit of the Waters! Evil prowls the seas of Maotu! O divine Spirit of the Waters, drive out the evil and bring back life and fish "

RAMANA 
"O divine Spirit of the Waters! Evil prowls the seas of Maotu O divine Spirit of the Waters, drive out the evil and bring back life and fish."

MAEVA
"O divine Spirit of the Waters! Evil prowls the seas of Maotu O divine Spirit of the Waters, drive out the evil and bring back life and fish."

FARATINA
"O divine Spirit of the Waters! Evil prowls the seas of Maotu O divine Spirit of the Waters, drive out the evil and bring back life and fish."

AURU
…and then the shriiiiimp! Oh No …!

AURU
What?

RAMANA
The Spirit is no longer here, he left us…

TIMETI
Auru!!!    

RAMANA
Auru!!!    

MAEVA
Auru!!!    

FARATINA
Auru!!!    

AURU
Uh hm hm

UNCLE PATRICK
Ah, Yann! Listen. I found this: scientists have realized that during hurricanes, fish are so disturbed that they are less fearful of their predators…

YANN
…And they all get eaten!

UNCLE PATRICK
But I don't see what predator could be that voracious as to eat so many fish and virtually empty the ocean!

YANN
Look Zoom and I discovered a whole shoal of lionfish. Look!

UNCLE PATRICK
hm ? Ouahou ! That's a Pterois volitans… 

YANN
Ah?!

UNCLE PATRICK
If Maotu gets infested by these fish, it'll be a disaster… We have to alert Papa-Tuanaku!

TIMETI
I don't believe it! You broke the invocation!

AURU
Well, sure, but everybody's doing real cool stuff. Thanks a bunch, I'm stuck picking up bits of wood with a kid! So thank you!

MARINA
Heeey!

AURU
Sorry, don’t take that personally, Marina. So what? Do you really think you'll bring the fish back by slapping the water?

RAMANA
We're not just slapping the water. It's a ritual called the music of the water. A Maotu ancestral tradition to come into contact with the Spirit of the Waters.

MAEVA
But because you interrupted the ceremony, it's all ruined!

AURU
Pff, I wanted to help, that's all… And, anyway, why didn't you take me with you? I love singing! "O divine mmmffff…"

RAMANA
It's a very precise and complex ritual, that cannot be improvised! That's why I only coach those capable of devotion and concentration… which is far from your case, young man.

AURU	
hm ! hm Uh hm

TIMETI
And now what do we do?

RAMANA
I'll discuss it with Papa-Tuanaku. We'll try to find some other solution…

AURU
Pff, I ruined everything… I'm totally useless… 

MARINA
No, no! You're just a bit silly now and then… But you're not useless!

AURU	
hm hm ?

MARINA	
hihihi !

UNCLE PATRICK
A lionfish…

PAPA TUANAKU
You say?

UNCLE PATRICK
It's an invasive species that infests the areas that it colonizes, eating all the other fish and crustaceans. Its stomach can expand more than thirty times bigger!

TAPUNA	
hm ?

PAPA-TUANAKU	
hm ?

YANN
Yes! And it might be responsible for the disappearance of the fish!

UNCLE PATRICK
Because of global warming and the hurricanes that it causes, these  lionfish are migrating to areas where they shouldn't be and are eating everything.

YANN
We have to organize the fishermen fast to get rid of them before they spread all over the atoll!

PAPA TUANAKU
Don't worry, Ramana is taking care of the problem right now.

RAMANA
Your son drove away the Spirit of the Waters, who now refuses to listen to us!

PAPA TUANAKU
Where is Auru? I've a word or two to say to him!

TIMETI
Hmm… I think he stayed back in the forbidden cave with Marina. 

PAPA TUANAKU
Good. Timeti, you go fetch them. Yann, you show the fishermen where you saw these fish. We'll take walkie-talkies to stay in contact.

AURU
"O-sorry-mister-spirit-of-the-water-we-didn't-do-it-on-purpose…"

MARINA
"Hey-can-you-bring-back-fish-in-the-sea-please-thankyou-mister-spirit-that’s-really-kind-big-hugs!"

AURU
Do you think he heard us?

MARINA	
hmhm

YANN
This is it!

PAPA TUANAKU
All right Guys? Let’s throw the net.

INAPO
Okay, boys, let's haul them in! HHhhh

UNCLE PATRICK    
Be careful. The Lionfish venom is extremely dangerous.

INAPO
Hhh! It’s heavy, we must have caught a ton!

PAPA-TUANAKU	
ah ah !

YANN
Papa Tuanaku! Why doesn’t he go up? Zoom go see what's going on!

TIMETI	
Uhh

MARINA
Come-on-Spirit-of-the-waters-give-us-back-our-fish-that-would-be-so-kiiiiind!

TIMETI
Auru! Marina! Don't tell me that you…

AURU
Don't worry, Timeti, we've got it covered!

TIMETI
Oh boy, oh boy, it’s a disaster…

YANN	
Uh !

UNCLE PATRICK
Oh no! he was stung?!

PAPA TUANAKU
Oucheeeewaaaaoooo! This burns like fire!

UNCLE PATRICK	
hm

YANN	
Uh?

TIMETI
Hello? Can you hear me? I found Auru and Marina. How are you doing?

YANN
Uh… not great… the net's stuck, we have an injured and there are lionfish everywhere…

YANN
We need help, Timeti, get over here!

TIMETI
Roger, but negative, I'm staying in the cave. I'm gonna try something…

MARINA	
hm

UNCLE PATRICK
We have to get Papa-Tuanaku to the Galleon. I'll treat him with heat, that's the only thing that can ease the pain.

YANN
Without me! I'm staying! 

UNCLE PATRICK
Yann! What are you doing?

TIMETI
Concentrate and copy me! The most important thing is the rhythm. It represents our hearts beating as one. Ready?

TIMETI
"O Spirit of the Waters! Forgive us. Hear our song and help us! May our seas retrieve their own. Cast out the lionfish while there is time. Forgive us. Hear our song and help us!"

YANN
hm ah! hm? Uh Sharks! They‘re going to save us!

UNCLE PATRICK
They're one of the few predators of lionfish. They're immune to their venom!

YANN
Hello, Timeti? Uh… there's a sort of miracle here… Sharks came out of nowhere and attacked the lionfish!!

AURU
It's no miracle, Shrimp! It's us! We played the music of the waters! The Spirit called the sharks to save us!

YANN
What are you talking about?

PAPA TUANAKU
Hey, can we discuss this later? I’am really hurting here!

PAPA-TUANAKU 
Thank you, Patrick! Great trick with the hot embers near the stings! I don’t feel any pain at all!

RAMANA
I must admit I misjudged you, my boy. If you like, I'll teach you all there is to know about the music of the waters.

MARINA
Uh Me too! Me too!

AURU	
hm ?!

TIMETI
"O Spirit! Continue to offer us the gifts of the ocean! We are grateful to you! Thank you!"

YANN
Heey! That's so cooooool!

PAPA TUANAKU
Yes, it's magnificent! And it's thanks to those songs that the sharks gathered and saved Maotu from the lionfish.

UNCLE PATRICK
Uh… hmm… that's not exactly proven…

YANN
It doesn't matter! What counts is that the fish are coming back and Zoom can hunt again! Right, Zoom?
