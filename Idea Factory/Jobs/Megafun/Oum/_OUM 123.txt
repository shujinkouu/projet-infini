PAPA-TUANAKU
Ah! Here you are.

PAPA-TUANAKU
This is my son, Auru. He knows the island like the back of his hand. He would make an excellent guide for your film!

AURU
What will I be on TV?

SHARK
Ohh

YANN
Now meet And this is my best friend: Zoom!
Shark flashes interest.

SHARK
A white dolphin? Incredible, I’ve never seen such a specimen!

YANN
You hear that, Zoom? John saw right away that you are unique!

SHARK
He can understand you? I’m impressed! What a perfect model of harmony between man and nature!

YANN
You’re my role model: I dream of making documentary films!

SHARK
I often shoot with two cameras, you could operate the second one, to get some practice!

YANN
Wooooow!

YANN
Do you realise? If I do this right, maybe he’ll hire me and I’ll be able to assist him on other films and go around the world! He’s really great!

PATRICK
Don’t get too excited. Shark doesn’t have a great reputation, you know.

YANN
But I’ll never get another chance like this! I thought you would support me…

PATRICK
Uhhh

AURU
I’ve been driving a dinghy since I was ten and diving since I was three! I’m as much at home in the water as on a boat… all you need to be a great assistant!

SHARK
A very ingenious system, Yann

YANN
Avec ça ont peux se parler

SHARK
Et aussi s'entendre sous l'eau

AURU
urhhmmm

AURU
I wasn’t lying. Have you ever seen so rich a wild life?

SHARK
Yeah, not bad, thanks Uaru!

AURU
Uh, the name’s Auru.

SHARK
Ohh urh urh urh Yann, scorpion fish!

YANN
Ohh wow! I’ve never seen so many at the same time! Auru, did you see that?

AURU
No, but I’ve just spotted a blue-ringed octopus. Come and see!

SHARK
Hmm, it doesn’t seem to want to come out…

SHARK
Oh, look! How beautiful it is! Get some pictures! Those manta rays are amazing! Let’s get some footage of that!

SHARK
hm hm oh urh uh uh regardez la pieuvre et sortie

AURU
Ohohah

YANN
Ohh?! uh

AURU
urh urh urh. Oh! hm. Oh no! orh hmm

SHARK
You know what Yann? You’d make a very good assistant. You’re patient and careful. 

YANN
Thank you mister Shark.

SHARK
Oh apelle moi John tout simplement 

YANN
Oh merci monsieur Shark!

SHARK
Take a break. You deserved that! Meanwhile I’m going to get a few shots of local life. You coming raunu?

AURU
Auru!

AURU
Yann, do you really think Shark is a good guy?

YANN
Of course! Why not?

PAPA-TUANAKU
I haven’t always been village chief. In my youth I was a bit of an adventurer myself before I met my dear wife Tapuna. 

SHARK
Oui mais Tell me about Zoom.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Oh... Uh... Well...

PAPA-TUANAKU
We could tell you lots about Zoom. He’s very brave and he’s saved Yann from Rahi’s jaws many a time!

SHARK
Rahi?

PAPA-TUANAKU
He’s a ferocious shark that often prowls around the sunken galleon.

SHARK
Uhhh hmm

SHARK
The footage from yesterday was very beautiful, but not very original. I’ve decided to make a film about Yann and Zoom. Your friendship is quite exceptional. Now that would make a really interesting documentary!

YANN
Do you hear that, Zoom. John is going to make a film about us!

AURU
As usual, it’s all about Yann and his big fish!

SHARK
Don’t worry, raunu, I’ll still need you to carry the camera!

AURU
Yesss!!

AURU
But the name is AU-RU!

AURU
I don’t trust this guy Yann… I think he smashed that octopus’ nest so he could film it!

YANN
What rubbish! That’s ridiculous! You’re saying that because you’re jealous… ranunu!

YANN
Ha, ha ha!

AURU
Uhh hmm

SHARK
He tres bien! Parfait! Formidable la uh saleté de corail hm urh uh 

YANN
Ohh

SHARK
Oh hehehe

YANN
It will take years for the coral you broke to grow back again.

YANN
You mustn’t destroy it!

SHARK
Ah you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs. mon petit can tu as interet a le comprendre That is if you want to make documentaries…

YANN
Nature is more important than a film!

SHARK
Oh ah eh hmhm I’m sorry, Yann you’re right. Listen, in any case, I only need one final sequence to finish my film.

YANN
You can do it without me!

SHARK
It’s just one sequence. I promise you I’ll be careful of the coral. Come on, You’re not going to throw away the chance of a lifetime and miss this film. That would be stupid!

YANN
All right, but just one slip and I’m quitting!

YANN
And so is Zoom!

SHARK
Uh Great!

AURU
The galleon belonged to Captain Cook. He’s The man who discovered Maotou. And Yann and I have explored it. It’s a fantastic story!

SHARK
I sure it is. You must tell me it some time, Raono!

AURU
The name’s… urh

SHARK
Oh beh I don’t see Zoom. We can’t finish the film without him.

YANN
I’m on it!

SHARK
You have a signal? Amazing!

YANN
Sure!

SHARK
Come here, handsome! I am so pleased to see you!

SHARK
Huh?!

YANN
Don’t worry, this time I’m keeping my eye on him!

AURU
hop

SHARK
hop

YANN
Uhh attention! 

YANN
mais il est fou pourquoi il reste planté la 

AURU
Eh c'est quoi ça 

YANN
Quoi?!

AURU
Over here!

YANN
A bag of rare meat!

AURU
Do you think it was John who put it here? To attract Rahi?

SHARK
Uh ohh ha ha 

YANN
Oh 

YANN
Hmm turn on your flash, we’ll blind it!

SHARK
Pfiew! It was close!

AURU
Yeaaah!

YANN
Yeaaah!

AURU
Do you realise the danger he put us in? I’m going to teach him what my name really is!

YANN
Wait, I’ve got a better idea!

YANN
Wow, that was so exciting! I can’t wait to see the footage! Do you often set up that sort of scenario?

SHARK
uh...

SHARK
Lure sharks to provoke fights? That’s my trademark! It’s cruel, but it sells! As I said: you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs!
