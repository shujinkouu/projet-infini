CRUSOE
Hey! Hello there! What a surprise?!!? What are you doing around here? Ah non désolé, je partage pas! You got a whole ocean full of fish, buddy boy! Hahaha! Did you see this? He wanted to take our lunch!

AURU
Ah, there you are, Yann! We’ve been looking for you all over!

TIMETI
We're gonna go surfing, you want to come with u... heu Uh, what's up?

YANN
It's Zoom. I don't know where he is. I've been calling him for hours. I'm beginning to get worried.

AURU
Rhooo Aw… Give your big fish a break. He's allowed to take time off?

TIMETI
Auru's right. The ocean's big.  He's probably gone to visit some other atolls.

AURU
Or else he met somebody more interesting than you.

YANN
ah ah ah Very funny. Zoom!

YANN
Zoom! Where’ve you been, huh? What? Looks like he wants to show us something!

YANN
It’s still hot! Looks like somebody made a fire here.

TIMETI
You think somebody is living on this motu?

AURU
Eh ! There! Footprints!

YANN
Let’s follow them!

TIMETI
Hé oh! Anybody there?

AURU
Cmon let's go

YANN
Hé oh! Does anybody ear me? wouhou!

TIMETI
wouhou!

AURU
You can see there's no ahhhh!

CRUSOE
What are you doing on my island? What do you want from me?

YANN
Easy… We don't mean you any harm. We're only here to help you.

TIMETI
Were you shipwrecked?

CRUSOE
It's none of your business!

CRUSOE
Get out!

CRUSOE
Go back where you came from!

YANN
Are you okay? We have a dinghy, we can take you to Maotou. We can take care of... ah!

CRUSOE
Non! 

CRUSOE
Listen, I'm fine where I am, and I don't want to see anybody! Get out of my place! Beat it! Scram!

AURU
ah!

TIMETI
woah!

YANN
ah!

CRUSOE
Grrr

AURU
ohoh Oh boy what a welcome! We'll come again!

TIMETI
I’m sure he’s hiding something!

YANN
Hey I know you! Tortina! Uncle Patrick, Marina and I saved her from turtle egg traffickers.

TIMETI
Huh?

AURU
Huh?

CRUSOE
What are you doing?  Don't touch her! Beat it! Get out!

YANN
There's something weird about that guy. We should tell the grown-ups about him.

PAPA TUANAKU
What is this story? A shipwrecked sailor who refuses to be rescued?

YANN
I promise you, we tried everything we could to persuade him to come with us, but he wouldn't listen.

PATRICK
We can't leave him alone on that island. It would constitute a failure to assist a person in danger.

PAPA TUANAKU
You're right. I'll come with you!

TIMETI
To be honest, I don't think that's a good idea.

YANN
Yes, he knows us already.

YANN
And above all, we will frighten him less than the two of you.

PAPA TUANAKU
What do you mean, frighten him

MAEVA
Do you think a chicken fafa would make him happy?

TIMETI
Great idea! Nothing like small pleasures to bring him back to civilization!

AURU
Seriously? We're really going back out there?

MARINA
I want to come! I'm dying to see Tortina again!

YANN
No, Marina, it's safer to wait till he realizes that we don't wish him any harm.

MARINA
hm?

PATRICK
Very well then. In the meantime we'll try to find out who this crazy Crusoe might be.

AURU
Look

AURU
gnnhnn

TIMETI
What are you doing? Put that down 

AURU
What if he pull the same stunt on us again!

YANN
You'll scare him! Drop it, Auru!

AURU
Well, for the moment, out of all of us he's the freakiest! So, I'm keeping this, and that's that!

MARINA
Shhhh.

PATRICK
No sign of any shipwreck in recent months… But a plane carrying a dangerous convict did crash into the sea. His body was never recovered.

PAPA TUANAKU
What if he were...

PATRICK
Yann! les enfants! Do you hear me? les enfants! Do you hear me?? les enfants!!

MARINA
Yoohoo! Tortina! Are you there? It's me! It's Marina!!

PAPA TUANAKU
We need to get out there! Now!

TIMETI
You know, he might be grumpy because he's hungry. Look, you can grouch for hours if you don't get your snacks.

AURU
Pfff That’s ridiculous! And I’m not the kind of guy who eats between meals. If I need a snack, I need a snack, that’s all!

YANN
Shhh! Be quiet!! I heard something

YANN
Sorry… it must have been my imagination

TIMETI
ah!

AURU
ah!

YANN
ah! Hey! Are you nuts??? We're here to help you!

TIMETI
What are you doing?

AURU
Hey! are you crazy!

CRUSOE
Oh yeah so what's that for!

TIMETI
Great… Nice work, Auru...

CRUSOE
Get moving

YANN
ohah

AURU
ah!

TIMETI
ah!

CRUSOE
oh! Martha?! Martha!? Martha!? It’s YOU who took Martha!?

YANN
Who?

AURU
Hey! you’re not making any sense!

CRUSOE
Martha?! Martha!? Martha!? And what's that 

AURU
That was a present for you! But, to be honest, we should keep it for ourselves, 

PATRICK
hm Yann only gave me the vaguest indications where this motu is. It could take us hours to find it.

PAPA TUANAKU
It’s Zoom!

PATRICK
Let’s follow him!

CRUSOE
Martha... Martha... Not here... Gone...  It’s gotta be them...

TIMETI
I think the fever's making him delirious...

YANN
uh Marina? Auru, create a diversion! Marina will free us.

AURU
A diversion? Are you joking or what... I know! Hey! You over there! I'm starving. . There's chicken fafa in the dinghy. Could you go get me some?

CRUSOE
No!

AURU
I'm warning you, I can be a real pain when I'm hungry!

TIMETI
Yeah he's not joking

AURU
Lalalalala I am starving! Lalalalala I’am really starving!

CRUSOE
gnnnn

AURU
Lalalalala J ai faim! Lalalalala I’am really starving!

YANN
No!

CRUSOE
hm

TIMETI
woah

CRUSOE
gnn

PAPA TUANAKU
uh

CRUSOE
oh ah

CRUSOE
Don't come near me!

PAPA TUANAKU
It's over! It's back to jail square one for you!

TIMETI
Jail?

YANN
Jail?

AURU
Jail?

PATRICK
He's a dangerous fugitive. He probably hoped to stay hidden here to escape the police!

CRUSOE
What? No… wait now, there's some misunderstanding!

MARINA
Hey! Look! It's Tortina!

CRUSOE
Martha! It's Martha! uh Martha!

CRUSOE
What are you doing? Don't touch her! 

PATRICK
It seems she's swallowed a great deal of plastic. I can't do anything here. We have to get her back to Maotou !.

CRUSOE
Please, save her!

CRUSOE
uh hmmm This is so good! Thank you so much for saving Martha! She'd been my sole friend during the three years I've spent on that island.

PATRICK
Three years?!

PAPA TUANAKU
Three years?!

PATRICK
The fugitive's plane crashed two months ago. This can't be him...

YANN
And now? Would you care to tell us who you are?

CRUSOE
My name is Philip Bergon. In a former life I inherited vast wealth. I spent my time wasting my money and gallivanting around the world on my yacht. But one day… a storm hit and I was shipwrecked on that desert island. I was alone and desperate… And when I thought it was all over, I met Martha. She stayed with me, showed me what could be eaten on the island. She taught me survival… In the end, it was by going back to the most basic things that I found a meaning to my life. So I told myself that I didn't ever want to leave. You must think I'm crazy. Preferring a turtle's company to that of humans...

YANN
Uh No, not really… You know, my friendship with Zoom is stronger than anything. But that doesn't prevent me from being friends with humans...

TIMETI
You know, Martha had a narrow escape, but other turtles won't all be so lucky. With your money, you could help change things and fight ocean pollution.

PHILIP
You're right… I spent enough time on that island. Now I have to make myself useful.

PHILIP
I wanted to announce the creation of my foundation, which will finance innovative ways to clear the oceans of plastic. A foundation that I have decided to call: Martha.

MAEVA
To Martha! Yeah!

KAI
À Martha!

CROWD
To Martha! Yeah!

KAI
Yeah!

PATRICK
The Coast Guard confirmed that Philip is not the man they were looking for.

PAPA TUANAKU
If there's a fugitive on the loose near Maotou, we need to stay on the alert.

YANN
If Philip goes back to the capital, we can keep Martha with us if she wants to stay.

MARINA
Hmm looks like Raoul doesn’t agree with that.

YANN
ahahah

TIMETI
ahah

AURU
ahah

YANN
hahaha
