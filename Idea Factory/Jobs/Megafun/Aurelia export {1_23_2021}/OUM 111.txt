MAEVA
Timeti hurry up, it’s getting cold ! I haven’t forgotten you, Zoom!

MAEVA
And here is my famous Ma’a Tinito!

MARINA
Oh no… Oh !

YANN
Erh

UNCLE PATRICK
Hmmm… it’s even better than last year! More spicy!

YANN
Hm… That’s delicious Maeva!

MARINA
Oh yes, really, really good! I love it !

MAEVA
They are so sweet, they’ve already eaten it all up.

UNCLE PATRICK
Hmm

MARINA
Aaaaaaah!

YANN
Ooooh!

UNCLE PATRICK
What is it, what’s going on here?

MARINA
Aaaaaaah!

YANN 
Aaaaaaah!

YANN
I’m wondering what sort of virus you two have picked up.

UNCLE PATRICK
Whatever it is, I wouldn't be surprised if the mah timito would be related to it! This is really itchy! let's go urh uh, I really don't feel good

MARINA
Well, are they still asleep or what?

UNCLE PATRICK
That’s odd, Maeva’s store should be open by now… Maeva orh urh

MAEVA
You too?

UNCLE PATRICK
Hmm

MARINA
And Raoul too!

YANN
Timeti, you too! Oh noo

PAPA TUANAKU
Since everybody is covered in spots, the cause of the sickness is easy to identify… right Maeva?

MAEVA
What? Oh no, you can’t say  it’s because of my Ma’a tinito? Yann and Marina ate it and look: no spots!

YANN
Well, actually… to tell you the truth, it was a little too spicy for us, so it was mainly Raoul who ate it in the end.

MARINA
We are so sorry, Raoul! hmm uh

MAEVA
No, I’m the one who’s sorry. I can’t understand how it happened: I did everything as usual…

UNCLE PATRICK
Sorry Maeva but, we should check all the same. If we find what caused the poisoning, we’ll know how to cure ourselves.

PAPA TUANAKU
Just do it !

MAEVA
…and I added a branch of pikopiko, my secret ingredient ! Which won’t be a secret any longer…

UNCLE PATRICK
This isn’t pikopiko !

UNCLE PATRICK
This is a pteridium aquilinum, a fern of the same species as pikopiko and rare in Polynesia, but this one is not edible!

MAEVA
I don’t believe it. How could I have mixed them up? 

MARINA
But we can’t leave Raoul like this!

YANN
Maybe Ramana can help us.

YANN
it itches so much

RAMANA
I advise you not to scratch yourselves: it will only make it worse.

AURU
Aaargh, that’s easy to say!

RAMANA
hmuhuhuhuh

MARINA
Raoul, you heard Ramana! Stop scratching!

UNCLE PATRICK
Ramana, do you know of any antidote?

RAMANA
Of course! Who do you take me for? I can mix some for you, but I will need sargassum… a lot of it. I’ve only this little bit left and this will never be enough.

YANN
I’ll go and fetch some!

RAMANA
And where might that be? You don’t even know where to look! Sargassum is a seaweed… that grows… deep in the ocean. Very, very deep.

AURU
I’ll come with you Yann!

YANN
Sorry, Auru, but you can hardly stand upright!

AURU
I don’t care. I’m not letting you go alone when MY village is in danger!

MARINA
I want to come with you too!

YANN
If you come with me who’s going to look after Uncle Patrick, Raoul and all the villagers? 

MARINA
hmuh

AURU
Alright, I’m coming, I’m coming! uh

AURU
Huh?

AURU
Uh… is he laughing at me?

YANN
Not at all, he’s not like that. 

YANN
Do you know this seaweed?

YANN
Do you know where we can find some?

YANN
Great! 

AURU
I hope your dolphin knows where he’s going. If we don’t find a cure soon, I’m going to scratch off all my skin !

MARINA
How are you feeling?

PAPA TUANAKU
The same as I did five minutes ago! That’s the twelfth time in an hour you’ve asked me the same question! It itches, it itches, it itches!

MARINA
Ah, no, you mustn’t scratch. Ramana said so. And that applies to you too, Raoul!

MARINA
I’ll keep an eye on you two…

PAPA TUANAKU
Urhh Uh Oof

MARINA
I see you

YANN
Is this it, Zoom?

AURU
uhuh haha arh

YANN
uh 

MARINA
hmm uhhh quick

TAPUNA
Aaaaah! That’s freezing!

MARINA
Of course, to bring the fever down!

TAPUNA
But I don’t HAVE a fever!

MARINA
Ah? Well, that’s no reason for you to scratch yourself!

TIMETI
Marina? Marinaaa? 

MARINA
Yes? What? What is it? What’s happening?

TIMETI
Marina, this is very important!

MARINA
What is?

TIMETI
I’m sure it’s got worse! Do you have a mirror?

MARINA
a mirror! Tadaaaa!

TIMETI
No, no, no, I’d rather not know!

TIMETI
Yes, go on, show me!  No, I don’t want to ! Yes, I have to know! Go on, I’ll be strong… Huh!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

AURU
hm hm hm hmmm uhh

YANN
hmm gnn

YANN
Do you understand now? You’re in no condition to help me!

AURU
You’re right. Go and get the antidote. I’ll wait for you here.

AURU
But hurry up, I don’t want to stay out here all night.

YANN
It’s a pity the sargassum doesn’t cure a bratty personality!

TIMETI
Urhh

JACK
Urhh

UNCLE PATRICK
Urhh

MARINA
There, now nobody can scratch themselves!

PAPA TUANAKU
And what if we get thirsty?

UNCLE PATRICK
Marina, I’m thirsty too!

MARINA
I’m coming!

PAPA TUANAKU
Uhh 

TAPUNA
uhh

MARINA
Oh no! You’re not allowed to take your gloves off!

TAPUNA
Oh Come on, Marina, just one teeny little scratch!

UNCLE PATRICK
Marina, Where’s my water?

MARINA
Yes! One second! I said no!

TIMETI
Can I have your mirror! I’m sure it’s got even worse!

PAPA TUANAKU
Can you scratch my back?

VILLAGER
I’m hungry…

VILLAGER 2
It itches!

VILLAGER 3
I feel so bad…

PAPA TUANAKU
Can you scratch my back?

VILLAGER 2
Do you have any nail clippers? 

VILLAGER 4
I’m thirsty!

VILLAGER 5
Me too !

VILLAGER
Come on Marina! Hurry up !

UNCLE PATRICK

VILLAGER  1

PAPA TUANAKU
Thank you, Ramana, your antidote worked really well!

RAMANA
Anytime !

AURU
I’m not sure about “worked”… I’ve still got a big spot here…

RAMANA
That is acne, my boy.

AURU
Huh?!

TIMETI
You guys are the best…thanks to you I’ve got a decent complexion again. moua moua

YANN
Gngnhihi

AURU

MARINA
Well, when I grow up, I’m  not going to be a nurse.

MAEVA
And to celebrate, how about I cook a delicious Ma’a Tinito?

PAPA TUANAKU
I’m not really hungry…

UNCLE PATRICK
I have an article to write!

YANN
Zoom’s waiting for me!

AURU
I’ve got enough spots already!

RAMANA
I have a potion cooking

MAEVA
Come back here! This time there’ll be no secret ingredient I promise hmm!
