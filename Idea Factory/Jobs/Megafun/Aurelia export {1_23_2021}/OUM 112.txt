RAMANA
hmm uh hmm uhh huhu

PAPA TUANAKU
Ever since the dawn of time, the men of the village in their turn have worn the Talisman of Courage. All who have worn it have felt the power of its magic increase their strength ten-fold.

PAPA TUANAKU
It is time for one of our young men to wear the Talisman for a whole day. He then returns it so that it can be entrusted to another, … until the end of time!

MARINA
Huuh!!

RAMANA
Receive the Talisman of courage as a reward for the feats you have accomplished in service of the village...Yann!

AURU
Is this a joke? The shrimp has no right to wear the Talisman! He’s an outsider! And anyway I’m much braver than he is!

RAMANA
It is not for you to decide, Auru.

PAPA TUANAKU
It's true.

PAPA TUANAKU
Yann and Zoom have proved that they deserve this honour. Your turn will come, my son. 

AURU
uhh Hmmm....

RAMANA
Yann, we entrust the Talisman, which is the pride of our village, to you. You will wear it for a whole day and benefit from its magic.

YANN
I shall try to be up to the job, Ramana.

PAPA TUANAKU
Take great care of it, my boy. 

RAMANA
Hmmm... hmm

YANN
I will ! 

YANN
Are you ready, Zoom? Let’s see if the Talisman can help me perform better surfing dance!

MARINA
Yann ! Have you seen MY magic talisman? It’s for Raoul! With this I’m sure he’ll be super brave!

J-S
Super brave!

MARINA
Now we have to test it and see if it works. By exemple, napping on a tarantula’s nest…

YANN
Why don't you give him a bath?

MARINA
Yeah good idea!

MARINA
Raoul! Come back! You’ll see: with the magic Talisman you won’t be afraid of the water anymore!

YANN
hehehehmm

YANN
so, you guys are ready to see some spectacular surfing?

TIMETI
are you sure ? The waves are going to be gigantic today!

YANN
With this around my neck, that shouldn’t be a problem!

AURU
Oh, come on ! Quit showing off! You'll be totally lame, as usual! 

YANN
close your mouth We’ll see about that!

AURU
pouet pouet little shrimp

AURU
whoaw

YANN
Uhhh uhhh uh 

TIMETI
oooh whoaw hop

YANN
ooooh ohhh 

AURU
hahaha gna uh?!

YANN
Tada super I wasn’t a bit scared… Thanks, the Talisman! where is it! 

YANN
Zoom! This is no time for playing! I’ve lost the talisman! ohh uhh 

YANN
oh uh hmm uh eh 

YANN
It’s no good, I can’t find it…

AURU
I told you so, shrimp you are so not worthy of wearing it!

TIMETI
Cut that out, Auru! You’d do better to help us!

AURU
hop hmm uh

TIMETI
It's impossible the current is too strong near the bottom! We can’t dive deep enough!

AURU
Oh ah I didn’t see anything!

YANN
But what am I going to tell Ramana and Papa-Tuanaku? 

TIMETI
I’m sorry, Yann… We can go and ask your uncle for advice. Maybe he will have an idea…

AURU
Huh… ! You do what you want, but I’m going home. Finding a necklace lost in the ocean is no big deal for me! see ya

UNCLE PATRICK
Well, if we follow the current, it should be...here!

YANN
So we just need to search at the foot of the cliff!

UNCLE PATRICK
In theory, yes. But in practice, it’s not possible.

TIMETI
Why not?

UNCLE PATRICK
non seulement un horage se prepare dans cette zone. They call this current the Shipwrecker. It’s one of the strongest in the region. 

YANN
But Uncle Patrick! I’ve lost the Talisman! It’s a disaster for the whole village.

UNCLE PATRICK
I know, Yann, I’m, sorry. But the Talisman is lost. You are going to have to tell Papa-Tuanaku.

YANN
ah uhhhh

AURU
Ha, ha ha! Talisman of Courage, here I come !

AURU
uhh ohh

YANN
Leave me alone, Zoom! If I hadn’t jumped off my board to avoid you, none of this would have ever happened!

TIMETI
Zoom has nothing to do with it! Why did you say that to him?

YANN
I don’t know, I… Zoom, wait! Come back! I’m sorry… I… uhh ohh uhh 

YANN
I can't believe this...

YANN
I lose the Talisman… I tell Zoom that it’s his fault… I hurt him… uhh I’m hopeless, Timeti.

TIMETI
No, you’re just a little clumsy. And you’ll see, Zoom will forgive you.

YANN
Maybe Auru was right after all. I should never have had the Talisman.

TIMETI
Stop it ! If Papa Tuanaku and Ramana entrusted the Talisman to you because they know you're very brave !

MARINA
Raoul, come back here now!

MARINA
uhh I tell you with that you'll super brave! 

TIMETI
hihihi

YANN
hehehe

YANN
Marina is right… 

YANN
If ever there was a day to prove my courage, it's today. 

TIMETI
hm uh

YANN
ih gn we're going to the cliff, but not a word to Uncle Patrick !

YANN
We can’t get down there! Jumping would be crazy! Uncle Patrick is right… there’s nothing we can do…

YANN
Too  bad. I’m going to explain everything to Papa-Tuanaku and Ramana… maybe they’ll forgive me for losing the Talisman.

TIMETI
uh Yann, look! Auru!

AURU
uh oh hmm

TIMETI
AURU! AURU!

TIMETI
Yann… what are you doing?

YANN
I have no choice, Timeti.

TIMETI
Yann, no! 

YANN
gnn uhh hop

TIMETI
oh

YANN
whoawwwwwwww

TIMETI
Yann!

YANN
I'm fine!

AURU
Yann uhh 

YANN
hang on auru I'm coming

AURU
uh Ohh gna gna

TIMETI
Ohhh orh

AURU
whoa uhhh

YANN
Let me go ! You're gonna sink with me, Yann !

YANN
no way !

YANN
ZOOOM!! ZOOOM!! ZOOOOM!

MARINA
Come on, Raoul! It’s nothing! I know you can do it! You just need to be a little brave! Brave, like Yann and Timeti on the cliff!

J-S
Yann and Timeti on the cliff!

UNCLE PATRICK
What’s all this about? 

UNCLE PATRICK
Where are Yann and Timeti?

MARINA
Uh… Raoul

TIMETI
whoa

YANN
Thanks, Zoom! My strength was running out!

AURU
We’re too heavy.

UNCLE PATRICK
Timeti, don’t!!

UNCLE PATRICK
All you would do is get yourself trapped along with them! We have to hook the rope around this rock and  climb them on the cliff one by one. Let's go uh

YANN
Haha!

UNCLE PATRICK
ah ah ah Hold on Yann!

UNCLE PATRICK
ah uhh gna ahhh

AURU
Ohhh

TIMETI
Auru

YANN
That was close !

YANN
Thank you, Zoom! You saved our lives!

YANN
and I’m so sorry about just now…

YANN
It’s because I was furious at losing the Talisman… ahhh I’ve no choice now: I have to tell Papa-Tuanaku…

UNCLE PATRICK
Yann! What you did was pure madness! Risking that current, diving off the cliff ! Don’t you ever do that again ! 

AURU
wait the shrimp had no choice, Patrick! He did it to save me.

UNCLE PATRICK
hmm Right...We’ll discuss this later… Let’s get back up.

YANN
uh uh

PAPA TUANAKU
What? You lost the Talisman?

RAMANA
But this is a disaster!!

PAPA TUANAKU
I told you to take great care of it.

YANN
I know…There's no excuse. The Talisman is lost forever… And it’s all my fault.

AURU
I’m not so sure, shrimp!

VILLAGER
Ah

VILLAGER 2
yeah

VILLAGER 3
bravo

UNCLE PATRICK
that's amazing

VILLAGER
hiphiphip Hooray bravo Auru

VILLAGER 2
Hooray and bravo Auru Hooray

VILLAGER 3
Hooray Hooray

PAPA TUANAKU
Well done,  son.

RAMANA
We were wrong. The Talisman should have gone to you, Auru.

AURU
no… if anyone deserves the Talisman today, it’s Yann. You dived from the great cliff and braved the currents to save me. I have never seen such courage.

YANN
Huh... oh thank you, Auru…

AURU
You owe me one, Shrimp!

YANN
uh oh

MARINA
For since the beginning of time those who wear the magic Talisman are super brave!

MARINA
And courage is the greatest of all qualities!

MARINA
Sometimes you need a...yummy motivation !

J-S
Raoul, super brave! Raoul, super br...
