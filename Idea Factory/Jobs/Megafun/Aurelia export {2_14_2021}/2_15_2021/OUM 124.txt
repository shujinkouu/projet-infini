YANN
Hu?

YANN
Yes, Zoom, this turtle needs help! Let’s get back to the galleon! 

MARINA
Have you seen this? It’s all yellow! What is it?

PATRICK
It looks like a paint mark. A boat must have hit her… Judging by the depth of the graze, it was moving fast… too fast…

YANN
But you’d have to be totally reckless! I’m going!

PATRICK
Going where exactly?

YANN
To find that boat! 

PATRICK
Be careful Yann!

YANN
Don’t worry. 

MARINA
Stay quiet in the box my little turtle! I’m gonna fetch your plaster to stick on your shell.

MARINA
Oh no! The little turtle!

YANN
Are you sure that this is where we found it?

YANN
And yet, There’s no boat in siiii aaah…

YANN
Hey, that guy is crazy! Come on, Zoom, we have to stop him before he really hurts somebody!

SAM
Four cylinders, sixteen valves! V hull! Multi-function dash! It’s got all package, you see? the lot, right?

AURU
Mmmm… to me it’s still scrap metal!

SAM
Hey, easy there! It may be scrap metal, but it can go really fast!

YANN
Hey! Didn’t anybody tell you that you’re not allowed to drive less than hundred metres from the shore and not exceed 5 knots?

SAM
Hey, Cool it, Mister Know at All! I’m here on vacation.

YANN
Oh! The yellow paint!

YANN
Vacation or not, you’ve already injured a turtle and you nearly ran over me just now!

AURU
Don’t you think you’re overreacting, shrimp?

TIMETI
Hi guys! What’s up?

AURU
Timeti?

YANN
Timeti?

MARINA
Poor little Turtle… What if something else were to happen to it? 

MARINA
You’re right. I want to have a clear conscious. Let’s go, Raoul!

MARINA
I’M GOING OUT IN MY CANOE, UNCLE PATRICK!

PATRICK
ALL RIGHT, BUT DON’T GO TOO FAR AWAY!

MARINA
Dont worry, Raoul is with me!

AURU
Timeti, you know them?

TIMETI
Here is Sam and Tom who are camping in the village. They’re two good friends of mine, I haven’t seen for a long time.

TOM
We are so happy to spend some times with our little princess for our holidays.

YANN
Uh, but… you’re identical…

SAM
Twins! Smart of you to spot it!

YANN
It’s crazy how much you two look like! 

TIMETI
hihihi

TIMETI
With twins that usually is the case!

AURU
The shrimp’s right! Your machines are really dangerous…

SAM
Hey, chill out, man! I know that you mustn’t see many Jet Skis. but…

YANN
We may not have Jet Skis, but… we have something better!

SAM
Vintage! Great!

AURU
My people have used these canoes for centuries. 

TOM
We’re not making fun, we’re just saying that with those things you can’t compete!

TIMETI
Stop arguing like kids!

YANN
Why don’t we just have a race?!

TOM
What?!!

YANN
Pirogues against Jet Skis!

TIMETI
Uh… Is this supposed to impress me? Because you’re wasting your time.

TOM
But that’s crazy, we’re bound to win!

YANN
If we win, you stop Jet Ski in the lagoon forever.

SAM
Okay but if we win, both of you, we’ll serve our breakfast every day for a month.

YANN
If that’s what you want… Let’s have a race!

TIMETI
OK, and so I just stay here and wait for you, is that it?

YANN
Sorry, Timeti? Were you saying something?

TIMETI
Forget it.

AURU
What’s got into you? We’ll lose and we’ll look like fools in front of Timeti…

YANN
Trust me.

AURU
You’d better know what you’re doing, Yann.

MARINA
Come on, Raoul... Stop sleeping and help me find the turtle...

YANN
We’re agreed then: the first one to set foot on that motu is the winner?

SAM
No problemo!

TOM
No problemo!

AURU
Timeti, will you give us the start signal?

TIMETI
Anything to oblige…

TIMETI
Ready… Get set… Go!

TIMETI
Great… This is gonna be a really fun day... 

TOM
Ha ha ha!

YANN
That’s kind of you, Zoom, but we have to win without cheating!

AURU
You see, he thinks we’re going to lose too.

YANN
No… come on, paddle!

SAM
WE’RE GOING TO WIN! WE’RE GOING TO WIN! IT’S A CINCH!

SAM
Ha ha ha ha!

TOM
Watch out for the coral, it’s fragile!

TOM
I told you to be careful with the coral!

SAM
I don’t care about that! Have you seen the state of my Jet?

TOM
I don’t want to tell you about what Dad’s going to say! 

SAM
Oh no!

YANN
Speed can’t do everything! You’ve also got to know the sea bed!

AURU
ha ha ha!

Auru 
OK, shrimp, I’m beginning to see what you’re playing at… Waka!

YANN
Waka!

SAM
They can’t win. I don’t believe it!

TOM
Get in Bro! We still have a chance!

MARINA
Hello, little turtle!

MARINA
It’s not you I’m looking for. Sorry to have bothered you.

MARINA
You wouldn’t be jealous, would you, Raoul?

MARINA
Now keep going!

MARINA
Hello, little turtle? Hello? Where are you?

SAM
A slight Oops! Accident! Sorry to have got your hopes up! 

TOM
We’ll be waiting for you on the island!

YANN
Look out! In front of you!

TOM
Oh... 

SAM
aaaah!

TOM
aaaah!

YANN
Let’s help them!

AURU
They haven’t surfaced…

YANN
The current must be dragging them down! Zoom, we have to save them!

SAM
Th… thanks…

YANN
You’re lucky, usually Zoom won’t let anyone hold onto him apart from me.

TOM
Thank you, Zoom! Right, this race is too exciting for me… I give up… I say that you’re the winners.

AURU
YANN, THIS IS GREAT! WE WON! WE WO…!

AURU
Ahem... Uh, nice work, shrimp…

SAM
Sorry but, the race is not over for me!

TOM
Sorry, My brother never gives up…

YANN
You’re not at all alike, actually…

SAM
SO, WHO IS THE WINNER THEN?

SAM

YANN

YANN
Are you all right? 

MARINA
I’m ok.

MARINA
I was looking for the little turtle we rescued this morning. I’m sorry.

YANN
Don’t worry. It’s not your fault.

TIMETI
So, is your ridiculous competition little boys’ war over now?

TOM
It’s true that we haven’t been very smart…

SAM
Sorry I was so pig-headed…

YANN
And careless! 

SAM
urh You’re right. Sorry again!

YANN
Well, I’m sure you will be more careful now!

AURU
Actually, if you want to spend some times in Polynesia, you got to learn something!

YANN
Come on, put a bit more oomph into it if you want to get to the village by nightfall!

SAM
That’s easy to say. I’ve already got blisters all over my hands.

AURU
Ha ha ha!

AURU
That’s all part of the tradition!

SAM
Hey I bet that in one week training, we’ll beat you!

YANN
Oh really? It’s a deal!

TIMETI
Oh no, you’re not starting again! 

SAM
Hahaha!

TOM
Hahaha!

YANN
Hahaha!

AURU
