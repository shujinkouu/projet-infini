Ha ha ha ! You're dreaming. She always had a crush on me !

YANN
Pff !Smooth talker !

AURU
Smooth talker? Let's see!

AURU
Come on, shrimp, the first one to the coral reef spends the day with Timeti!

YANN
Don’t you think we should ask her opinion first?

YANN
Hey!

YANN
That’s strange! Qu'est-ce qui est arrive aux coreaux?

PATRICK
Aargh! Dratted cylinder head! Will you work or not?

YANN
Uncle Patrick, we discovered parts of the coral reef that were turning white. It was very weird.

PATRICK
Coral can turn white for a number of reasons. I need to take a closer look at this.

PATRICK
That’s what I was afraid of, cyanide…

YANN
Cyanide? But who would put cyanide on the coral?

PATRICK
Some fishermen use the technique to stun fish and sell the finest specimens to aquariums! It’s totally illegal! Cyanide is poison to the coral and its inhabitants.

YANN
But that’s awful! We have to stop these poachers.

PATRICK
Here, we’ll find out more about them by setting this camera up amongst the coral!

YANN
Great! So we can follow what’s going on underwater live.

AURU
Well, I’m off then

YANN
Hey, Auru!

YANN
Aren’t you coming?

AURU
Uh, you know, it doesn’t need two of us to fix up a camera… And I won the race, remember, if you see what I mean!
  
YANN
As you want. I can easily manage without your help! You coming, Zoom?

YANN
Zoom ! Are you all right?

AURU
He doesn’t look so good, he’s all pale. Ha ha ha ha! I’m so funny!

YANN
Are you tired? I’ll go by myself. I’ll be back soon.

MARINA
Can I try?
TIMETI
Oh yes, of course Marina!
MARINA
La la la la la! You like it?
 
TIMETI
Yes, uh… that’s… that’s a good… 

AURU
…yes, a good start for bursting everybody’s eardrums! 

TIMETI
What are you doing here?  Aren’t you with Yann and Zoom?

AURU
The shrimp? Oh no, he’s investigating some guys who are fishing with cyanide. But without his big fish for once.

TIMETI
Really? Why’s that?

AURU
Oh, he’s not feeling that well. So, what shall we do?

TIMETI
Zoom is sick? Oh no!!

MARINA
Zoom is sick? Oh no!!

AURU
Hu? 

AURU
Hey! Wait for me!

YANN
Zoom! What’s happening? 

YANN
Oh Zoom! You really look bad!

PATRICK
Quand vous etiez pres des coreaux, est-ce que tu l'as vu manger des poissons?

YANN
Sure! Why asking?

PATRICK
Well... It must have had cyanide on its scales… 

YANN
Tu veux dire qu'il a ete empoisonne? Il faut aller le veterinaire.

PATRICK
But it’s too far away! I have to repair this part of the Taaora’s engine first. It’ll take me several hours.

YANN
But we don’t have several hours!

TIMETI
What if we went to see Ramana? He will probably be able to do something for Zoom.

YANN
I’m sorry, but… Zoom needs a vet, not herbal potions. I… I prefer to wait…

MARINA
Well, I have confidence in Ramana! I’m not staying here and doing nothing!

TIMETI
I am coming with you Marina!

AURU
Yann! Look here!

YANN
Oh no...

YANN
Biff and Rick! I should have known! Grrr!

AURU
It’s just a thought, but the guys using cyanide might have an antidote in case of accidents… 

YANN
Of course! You’re right… I have to go! No, I have to stay here, I can’t leave him alone.

AURU
Don’t worry, Yann, I’ll look after your “big fish” until the girls get back.

YANN
You’d do this for Zoom?

AURU
Yes… And for the island… Besides, you have to find those two idiots before they destroy the whole coral reef.

YANN
You’re right!

PATRICK
OUCH! Wretched engine!

YANN
Don’t say anything to Uncle Patrick, he’d only worry.

AURU
Ok!

YANN
Dis-lui que je vais faire des courses pour Maeva!

TIMETI
Sorry to disturb you, but Zoom is sick!

MARINA
And he needs a cure, hurry!

RAMANA
This is a very bad time! I can’t stop dancing till nightfall on pain of angering the spirits!

TIMETI
The spirits will understand, Ramana. Zoom has swallowed cyanide and only you can save him!

RAMANA
Du cyanure? Ah oui, je vois! On va chercher les ingredients, mais en musique! Timeti joue-donc de ton ukulele pour que je ne perde pas le rythme. 

TIMETI
What? Uh… Yes, all right, if you like…

RAMANA
Ne pas tomber, voila.

RAMANA
Yeah, that’s groovy!

RAMANA
There I found some!

TIMETI
And we also need seaweed, is that right Ramana?

RAMANA
Yes, arthrospira maxima, but play a little faster, the rhythm’s getting sloppy, the spirits will not be pleased!

RAMANA
Aaaah, the rhythm! Go on, go on, play!

MARINA
Ramana! Ramana! We’ve got the seaweed!

RAMANA
Perfect! Now we’ve got everything. Let’s prepair the antidote!

MARINA
Arthrospira… Maxima!

YANN
Cyanide…

RICK
That’s a really bad idea, kid…

YANN
Biff and Rico. You’ve made Zoom sick! You deserve to go to jail!

RICK
To jail? For a dolphin? That’s a good one!

YANN
At least I hope you’ve got an antidote.

YANN
You have an antidote?

RICK
Of course we have an antidote! Remonte toutes les nas a notre place. You have my word, you’ll get the antidote.
RICO
Think about your dolphin.

YANN
J'espere que t'as vraiment l'antidote.

BIFF
You never told me that we had an antidote…

RICK
There isn’t any antidote! I had to fool him so he’d do all the work for us!

BIFF
Oooook! That way we can stay quietly on the boat!

RICO
There you go.

RAMANA
Great spirits of Maotou, take pity on this poor dolphin, and may this sweet tasting potion bring him lasting relief!

PATRICK
Bravo!

RAMANA
Bravo!

MARINA
Bravo!

TIMETI
Bien joué!

RAMANA
That’s what I call team wordk! Isn’t it?

AURU
Come on Zoom, it's for your own health.

TIMETI
Yaaay!

RAMANA
Hurray!
 
AURU
Hurray!

PATRICK
Hurray! Hurray! Merci pour la potion, Raman! It’s a pity Yann isn’t here to see it! 
 
AURU
Well, actually he didn’t really go to Maeva’s...

AURU
He went visiting Biff and Rico.

PATRICK
What?

RICK
There, four aces!

BIFF
Lucky dog! It’s great having this new recruit, it’s much less tiring like this…

YANN
That’s it, Okay, I’ve fulfilled my part of the bargain! You have to keep your word now!

RICK
Keep our word? What is he talking about? Come on, Hit the gas, Biff!
YANN
Hu?

BIFF
C'est parti mon kiki!

YANN
Hey! Come back!

YANN
Zoom!! You’re all right! I am so happy to see you fit again! 

AURU
Ha ha, you little shrimp! Always has to be the centre of attention!

YANN
Very funny! We have no time to loose, Biff and Rico are ruining the lagoon!

PATRICK
Let’s chase them!

RICO
Aaaah!

BIFF
Rico?

RICO
Oh no! My fish!

BIFFOuch! Help!

AURU
No poachers allowed on board!

PATRICK
Notre petit paradis n'a vraiment pas besoin de cette salete.

BIFF
Au secours! Au secour!

PATRICK
If I ever see you with this again, you’ll have the coastguards to deal with!

RICO
There are some days when I wish I could change my job!

BIFF
Oh yeah! Me, i'd like to be a baby-sitter.

RICO
Shut up nuthead!

RAMANA
It’s so good of you, my boy, to have replaced me for the dance of the spirits, I’m so stiff that I can’t feel my body anymore.

YANN
Don’t mention it, Ramana, I want to thank you for saving Zoom, this is the least I can do…

AURU
Stop talking, shrimp, you’re losing the rhythm!

YANN
Uh… how long do I have to keep this up?

RAMANA
Until the sun sets et la lune aussi!

AURU
The rhythm! The rhythm!

TIMETI
The rhythm! The rhythm!

MARINA
The rhythm! The rhythm!

AURU
Hahaha

TIMETI
Hahaha

MARINA
Hahaha

YANN
Hahaha
