AURU
Is this the best you can do, Inapo?

VILLAGERS
Yeah!

MARINA
I don’t understand, Uncle Patrick. Isn’t the big race next week?
    
PATRICK	
Yes, but now they are deciding who will represent Maotou in the inter-island competition.

MARINA
So why isn’t Yann taking part?

PATRICK
Ah, you’ll have to ask Papa-Tuanaku.

VILLAGERS
Yeah!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Ha, ha! A real chip of the old block! When I was his age, nothing could stop me! A regular speed boat!

AURU
Who’s The champion? It’s me, me meeeeeee! Ouh Ah Ah I’m the champion! Aaaaoutch ! Aaaaaaaah !

AURU
Well?

RAMANA
Well, you’ll need to keep that plaster cast on for several weeks. 

AURU
What?

RAMANA
You’ll have to find a replacement for the inter-island competition.


AURU
Inapo?
    
INAPO	
Me? No, no, no. Honestly, you saw me. I swim like a brick. With me we’re sure to lose.

YANN
Uh… Well, why not… me?

PAPA-TUANAKU
The rules are strict: only inhabitants of the villages can take part. 

TIMETI
Why not you, Papa-Tuanaku? With a champion like you it would be a walk over sure win!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Me? Ha, ha… but I’m far too old experienced for that. It’s for the young folk.

RAMANA
It’s your destiny Tuanaku! You will be our champion! 

PAPA-TUANAKU
Ha ha ha Oh, well if you insist. Ha ha ha..

PAPA-TUANAKU
Come on, Tuanaku… You’re not scared… You’re not scared…

PAPA-TUANAKU
Help! Help! I… I can’t swim!

YANN
Let’s go Zoom!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Je ne sais pas nager!

YANN
What happened?

PAPA-TUANAKU
You see, I... I got a cramp!

YANN
Really? I’m sure I heard somebody shouting “I can’t swim”!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Ha, ha, ha! Well you need to wash your ears out more often, my boy!

PAPA-TUANAKU
OK… I can’t swim…

YANN
But everybody thinks you’re a champion swimmer!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I know, I know, it’s all my own fault. I nearly drowned when I was little and I’ve been scared of the water ever since. So I lied to everybody. A chief who can’t swim… can you imagine?

YANN
I’ll teach you, if you like.

PAPA-TUANAKU
You’d do that for me Yann?

YANN
Of course. It would be my way of taking part in the competition.

PAPA-TUANAKU
All right, but promise me you won’t tell anyone. Especially not Auru!

YANN
I promise !  Don’t worry, We will find a discret spot to train. 

AURU
Aargh! I’m fed up with all this sitting around. I have to get up… Crutches!

TIMETI
Look here, Hopalong! It’s your foot that’s out of commission, not your manners!

AURU
Sorry, Timeti. It’s just this darned cast you see…… Luckily my father agreed to replace me. You’ll see he’ll beat them by a mile! He’s an outboard motor! A torpedo!

YANN
Come on, go a bit further in!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I caaaan’t! It’s too cold!

YANN
The water’s 30 degrees celsius…
  
PAPA-TUANAKU
Aaah! A crab Something just bit my toe! It hurts… ouch, ouch!

YANN
Listen. The honour of the village is at stake. You have to make an effort!

PAPA-TUANAKU
All right, then I’ll do my best.

YANN
Yeah! Go on!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I’m doing it ! I’ve done it, I’m swimming, I’m swimming! 

PAPA-TUANAKU
So, can I go home now?

PAPA-TUANAKU
Aaaaaah!

PAPA TUANAKU
ha ha ha

PAPA-TUANAKU
Did you see that ? I almost I… nearly wasn’t frightened scared at all! Thank you, thank you, Zoom!

YANN
If Zoom can help you overcome your fear then you have to grab the chance and learn how to swim.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Yes, but you know, with all my duties as chief, I won’t have the time to…

YANN
We have less than a week. You have to practise every day. 
               
PAPA TUANAKU
Aaaaaaah!

YANN
Good job! Keep going!
       
PAPA-TUANAKU
Yann, regarde, je nage!

YANN
Bravo!

PAPA TUANAKU
Waaaaaa, woow!

YANN
Oui quand meme! Bon, c'est pas gagne, mais y'a du progres! On se retrouve ce soir pour une derniere lecon.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Et si on faisait plutot une petite pause.

TAPUNA
Hey, hey, hey, where are you off to? We haven’t finished!

PAPA-TUANAKU
It’s just… I have to go and train practice for the competition.

AURU
Really? Cool! Can I come?

PAPA-TUANAKU
Well, uh… You see, I need to be alone to learn… uh… I mean... to practise my swimming… The secret of success! 

AURU
Is it me, or is he being weird just now?

YANN
Come on! Head under! You can do it!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Okay! Okay! Just a moment!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I did it! I can swim! I can swim! I… 

PAPA-TUANAKU
Auru, wait!

AURU
You lied to me! You lied to us all! You can’t even swim! “A speed boat”! 

YANN
Auru! Your father can swim when he’s out of his depth and he can now put his head underwater.

AURU
Wow! Fantastic! We’re really going to impress the other islands.

TIMETI
Is everything all right, Auru?

AURU
Timeti, Can you keep a secret, Timeti? 

TIMETI
Yes, of course.

AURU
My father lied to us… He can’t swim. I caught Yann teaching him.

TIMETI
What?! You mean, when he said he’d been a champion, all that was…

AURU
Barefaced lies!

TIMETI
Well, it’s not that serious. You’re never too old to learn, right?

AURU
Yeah... But apparently he’s not too old to lie.

TIMETI
Where are you going?

AURU
Fishing!

MARINA
whispers

MAEVA
Oh! 

MAEVA
whispers

INAPO
Oh!

INAPO
whispers

VILLAGERS
whispers

AURU
Aaargh! Can’t I be left in peace for two minutes? I’m fishing, can’t you see? 

AURU
Go away! You scare the fishes! Ahhh!

AURU
Leave me alone! I know how to swim! I don't need help!

AURU
No worries OUM, I'll be okay!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I lied to my son, I lied to my people.
  
YANN
They will forgive you.

PAPA-TUANAKU
I know what I have to do.

YANN
Hey Zoom! What’s that? I know this necklace. Auru is in danger! Papa Tuanaku! Papa Tuanaku!
 
PAPA-TUANAKU
Here is my resignation...

TAPUNA
You’re surely not going to resign over this ridiculous matter?

PAPA-TUANAKU
Ridiculous… Yes, that’s the word… A chief cannot afford to look ridiculous. I’m sorry, my dear.

YANN
Wait! I’m afraid something may have  happened to Auru!

PAPA-TUANAKU
My son! Everyone to your canoe. We have to search the area!

AURU
Heeeelp!
  
YANN
He’s over there!

AURU
Heeeeelp!

TAPUNA
Oh my god! He can’t swim with his plaster!

AURU
Au secours!

TAPUNA
Yeah!

YANN
Yeah!

AURU
I’m sorry dad... I was...

PAPA-TUANAKU
It’s okay my son, I’m here.

VILLAGERS
Hurray!

INTERCOM
And so the inter-island comes to a close with victory going to the island of Aniata… Meanwhile, I’m told one contestant has yet to finish. And, yes, here he comes: it’s Papa-Tuanaku of the island of Maotou.

VILLAGER
Yeah! Youhou! Yeah! Wouhou!!

AURU
Great Dad, you did it! I’m so proud of you.

RAMANA
You maybe arrived last but you proved your courage! You are worthy to be our chief!

PAPA-TUANAKU
It’s honnor!

TAPUNA
My dear, we all contribute to offer you that.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Thank you my friends! Yann, I own you one.

YANN
Non, elle est a toi!

SWIMMER 1
Well, now if we begin to give a cup to the losers, I stop ... 

SWIMMER 2
Laisse tomber, et parle pas trop fort non plus, le chef est juste derriere toi.
