Are you sure you’re going to manage all alone? If not we can close, like we usually do!

TIMETI
But Mum! And lose a day’s business? I know that I’m ready to run the restaurant!

PATRICK
Yes, And Yann will be there to help her!

YANN
I’ll do my best!

MARINA
Me too! And Raoul!

PATRICK
And with Zoom to lend a helping hand, there’s nothing to worry about! We have to go now. Your stock of spices won’t replenish on it’s own, and no spices: no restaurant!

PATRICK
See you, kids!

TIMETI/YANN/MARINA
Byyye!

MARINA
hahaha The restaurant all to ourselves; we’re going to have such fun! Woohooo! hahaha

TIMETI
No, we have to be serious! If everything goes well, Mum will let me run the restaurant more often. And maybe one day it will be called Timeti’s Place!

YANN
Hello Timeti! Earth Calling!

MARINA
hihihi

TIMETI
Our first customer! Everybody in position!

YANN
Yes, Chef, Sir!

MARINA
Yes, Chef, Sir!

JACK
Hello folks! I could eat all shark today!

YANN
This way please!

MARINA
Today we have Maeva’s famous chicken fafa or fish in coconut milk. And Timeti is doing everything all by herself!

TIMETI
Hi Jack!

jack
Ooh, they’ve changed the cook? In that case, I believe I shall be tempted by the chicken fafa.

YANN
An excellent choice! One chicken fafa!

TIMETI
And one chicken fafa! One!

TAPUNA
Good morning!

AURU
Hi there!

tapuna
Isn’t Maeva here?

TIMETI
No, she’s gone to the mainland for the day. So I’m taking care of the restaurant!

tapuna
You’re in charge of the dinner tonight then? 

TIMETI
The dinner tonight?

TAPUNA
Yes, my husband is being host to all the mayors of the atoll. I left very precise instructions with your mother.

TIMETI
Hummm.... the dinner, of course!

AURU
So, I see Timeti is baby-sitting you and your little sister!

YANN
No sense! Marina and I are here to give her a hand! We’re running the restaurant, all day,  together… 

tapuna
… it’s the most important dinner of the year, the island’s reputation is at stake. Everything must be ab-so-lute-ly perfect!

YANN
Everything will be ready for this evening, but you must let us work now!

AURU
Don’t worry, Mum, I’ll stay and help them!

tapuna
Oh, he’s so sweet, my son! Always openhearted and ready to be of service! I’m counting on you for tonight.

AURU
No way am I going to leave you alone with Timeti all day long!

TIMETI
Why didn’t Mum say anything? She didn’t even leave me any instructions!

YANN
“Menu: Tapuna’s party”. This must be it! It’s all down here. 

TIMETI
Raw fish salad, Fish curry with sweet potato, Coconut fish fafa… and it goes on! I’ll never manage it!

YANN
We’re going to help, right, Auru?

AURU
Yes, with three of us we should be able to do it!

TIMETI
Cool!

MARINA
Hey Guys! It’s Ramana!

TIMETI
Okay boys, you help me in the kitchen!

AURU
Yes Chef!

YANN
Yes Chef!

TIMETI
Marina you take care of the customers!

MARINA
Hello, Ramana! I’m your waitress today! What do you want to eat?

RAMANA
I’d like a chicken fafa …

MARINA
Uh…

MARINA
I’ll be right back! RAOUUUUL !!!

MARINA
Raoul! I can’t take you anywhere!

MARINA
Sorry about that, sir!

MARINA
If I don’t watch him, he can be very naughty. Another customer! Look after him!

RAMANA
Tu ne mangeras pas dans mon assiette?

AURU
hahaha

YANN
hahaha

AURU
haha Huh ?!

AURU
A patatoe right in your face!

TIMETI
We’ll never manage this if you don’t concentrate a little!

YANN
But it was him that…

AURU
But it was him that…

RAMANA
Can I have my plate?  I want chicken fafa.

MARINA
Here you are.

RAMANA
Uh? That’s not my chicken!

MARINA
It’s while you wait: Inapo took the last serving. Timeti has to make more!

RAMANA
But I was here first!

MARINA
Yes, but he ordered faster!

RAMANA
But…  I guess it’s better than nothing…

RAMANA
Daaaaaahh!! Just wait till I get my hands on you!

TIMETI
Bye, Jack!

JACK
Thanks a lot kids! Best chicken fafa ever!

TIMETI
I need a big pot!


MARINA
Timeti?

TIMETI
Oh nooo!

TIMETI
The important thing is not to panic… Yann, do the dishes!

AURU
hahaha 

TIMETI
I need fish. Auru, can you go and buy some from the fishermen?

AURU
Oh no, I’ll stink of fish all afternoon!

RAMANA
Excuse me...

YANN
Zoom, aim at the dish!

MARINA
Hey, that's disgusting! Timeti, Yann is getting Zoom do the dishes!

YANN
Well... It’s quick and, what’s more, it’s ecological!

TIMETI
I’m not sure our customers would appreciate it! Stick to the sponge and the soap, please!

AURU
Sorry I took so long: I had to go to several fishermen, these are the last fish they had!

YANN
Yes, you really wanted me to finish the dishes by myself!

TIMETI
Stop arguing!

TIMETI
Take the fish out and clean them.

YANN
Wait i’ll help you!... After you!

AURU
Heeeey!! Ah.. Hahahaha It tikles! hahaha! 

TIMETI
My fish!

TIMETI
I shall never be able to complete Tapuna’s order and my mother will never trust me again.

YANN
We’re really sorry, Timeti, it was all our fault… Uh, I think something’s burning…

TIMETI
What?? Oh no… Ramana’s chicken fafa… It’s ruined!

RAMANA
Is this your idea of a joke?

YANN
Timeti. I promise you we’ll make up for it! We’ll just go and catch some more fish!

AURU
Smart thinking, shrimp.

TIMETI
Okaaaaay… But…

TIMETI
You have less than an hour to leave me enough time to cook them!

YANN
It’s a deal! Let’s go!

AURU
Yeah!

RAMANA
And don’t forget my chicken fafa, right?

AURU
Ha, ha! Watch a real fisherman at work!

YANN
Timeti will never forgive us.

AURU
You mean, Timeti will never forgive you!

YANN
You are joking, I hope!

AURU
It was your dolphin that ate them!

YANN
It you that made them fall...

AURU
Hey regarde...

YANN
Woah! Look at this!

AURU
Woah! This is amazing!

YANN
Zoom! You are a genius!

YANN
A job well done! Let’s go!

AURU
gnn

YANN
Oh, way to go, Mr Muscles!

AURU
Excuse me if I don’t have shrimpy arms like you.

MARINA
Voila! Nice hot chicken fafa !

MARINA
Uh-hooo! Timetii!

MARINA
Tapuna’s coming! 

tapuna
Do you have something to tell me?

TIMETI
Yes, hemmm… everything’s going well!

tapuna
Can I take a look then?

TIMETI
Oh no, impossible! You might find out all the secrets of my cooking! Come back later, thank you for your visit!

TIMETI
Zoom! What happened?

TIMETI
The boys must be having a problem. I’ll go and look for them! You take care of the restaurant! But no touching the kitchen, understood?

YANN
We’ll never bring those fishes in time. 

YANN
Timeti will be so mad at us!

AURU
Yeah, that’s for sure especially the way you paddle!

YANN
If somebody didn’t break the engine, we wouldn’t have to paddle at all...

AURU
And if somebody hadn’t put that fish on my short... We wouldn’t have to...

TIMETI
Are you all right 

AURU
Yeah, we’re fine but the motor broke down!

YANN
Great job, Zoom!

TIMETI
Wow! Well done, boys. Hurry maybe all is not yet lost!

MARINA
