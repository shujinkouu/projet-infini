YANN
Marina, can you hear us?

MARINA
Yes Yann, it’s working! Raoul, stop!

YANN
Hey be careful, Marina! That walkie talkie is fragile!

TIMETI
Ha, ha! I think she needs some help!

MARINA
Don’t put that in your mouth, it’s dirty! Hmm….

YANN
It’s beautiful!

TIMETI
It’s horrible! Legend tells that the double rainbow forewarns the wrath of the shark god!

YANN
The wrath of what?!

VILLAGERS
The wrath! / Oh no! / It’s coming!/ Oh no!

PAPA TUANAKU
Calm down, people! I know the myth relate, all the island will be destroyed by the big wave, six hours after the apparition of the double rainbow. But, there may be a solution! If someone succeeds to go down into the bottom of the lagoon, and place this offering of fish, it will appease the shark god!

TIMETI 
But that is 135 metres down and nobody already dives too deeply, it’s too dangerous!

AURU
Well, I can do it!

PAPA TUANAKU
Now that is the reaction of a future chief! Auru, You will be the brave soul who will place the offering, Auru!

YANN
I come with you if you like, those company after all!

AURU
If you want to, but I'm placing the offering.

PAPA TUANAKU
And to support you in that mission, our shaman will come with you!

PAPA TUANAKU
Oh, Ramana?

YANN
What’s happening Ramana?

RAMANA
It’s my fault if the shark god is angry! I broke the sacred drum of his ancestors! And just after the double rainbow appear! I’m the one whose responsible for this tragedy !

RAMANA
I’m not worthy of being shaman of the village anymore! I have to leave!

YANN
But that’s no reason to leave us!

RAMANA
Oh boy, I can’t save the village, unfortunately!

PATRICK
We all need you, Ramana. Help us to appease the shark god and placing offering in the lagoon. 

RAMANA
But I cannot But I’m too old to dive into the trench of the lagoon! 

YANN
Maybe you can make amends some other way?

RAMANA
No. I believe I have lost my mana. Ahhhhhhh! And a shaman without a mana is no use at all! 

MARINA
So, Auru is going to put himself in danger and Ramana is leaving, and all that because of a rainbow!

PATRICK
No, Marina, all that because they have values! Beliefs and customs that we have to respect.

YANN
But respect doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do anything. I think I have an idea to help our shaman to regain his faith! 

RAMANA
Goodbye Tuanaku!

PAPA TUANAKU
Ramana, maybe the wrath of the shark god is not your fault! Please, don’t go!

TAPUNA
Ramana, the boys need you! How could they succeed without you?

MARINA
Ramana doesn’t need to leave the village! We’ve got talkie-walkie! With this, Ramana can be part of the mission and help Yann and Auru in the lagoon!

PATRICK
She’s right, Ramana. You’ll stay with me on the boat, and from there we both will guide boys placing the offerings.

RAMANA
Let me see that thing... Hmm hmm... I think it’s worth trying! 

YANN
Oh non, l'offrande!

PATRICK
C'est pas gagner!

RAMANA
Yann, as I can’t come down, I give you these magical herbs to protect you. They are very powerful my boy, use that only in case of emergency! Uh... It’s not worth thanking me. 

YANN
Oh, right, well great… thanks! See ya!

RAMANA
Hello?? Hello? it’s not working !

MARINA
Hum ! Hum !

RAMANA
Oh, alright. As I was saying: Don’t worry, I have the situation under control!

AURU
Well received, Ramana.

RAMANA
I te fenua nei. Mai te i. I ma'a e au matou…

PATRICK
Please, Ramana, this is not the right time! We all have to stay concentrated!

RAMANA
Aaargh, you have just broken the positive energy field! Where is my purification candle…

PATRICK
They’ve reached the 50 meters mark. They have to change tanks!

RAMANA
What do you mean “tanks”? Who is in tanks?

MARINA
Air tanks! That’s what they call the diving cylinders. You have to tell Yann and Auru to change them.

PATRICK
If they don’t change gas now, they will be in danger!

RAMANA
Aaaaah! Why didn’t you say so? Change your gases!

YANN
Thanks, Zoom!

AURU
Ha, ha, ha! You sound like a girl! Uh… Ha, ha, ha! Oops! Mine too!

YANN
Ramana What’s happening to us?

RAMANA
It’s your uncle’s fault! 

PATRICK
Of course not! It’s the new gas mix!

PATRICK
Don’t worry about that, the effect will stop in few minutes.

YANN
The water pressure… is getting heavier and heavier… it’s getting hard…

AURU
Be brave, Shrimp. We have to save the village.

YANN
Zoom, you have to go back up to breath that’s more than fifteen minutes that you took a breath!

YANN
Don’t worry. It’ll be all right.

YANN
We’re nearly there! Only another twenty meters!

AURU
Yeehaa! The hardest part is over! 

YANN
Uh… are you all right, Auru?

AURU
Aah, hahaha I’ve never felt so good in my life!

YANN
Oh no!

AURU
Heeh, look who’s heeeere! Hi there, big fella! hahaha, Il revient le copain requin!

YANN
Oh my!

RAMANA
What’s happening down there?

YANN
Rahi’s The big shark is circling us. Zoom’s not here and Auru’s gone totally nuts!

RAMANA
Did you give some magical herbs to Auru? Because it’s possible that uh…

PATRICK
That’s got nothing to do with it! Yann listen to ME! Some people get a sensation of euphoria when they dive too deep! STAY CALM AND COME BACK UP SLOWLY! RAMANA, GIVE THAT BACK TO ME! 

RAMANA
No!

PATRICK
YES GET THAT BACK!

RAMANA
No!

MARINA
Stoooop it!

YANN
Auru! Look out!

AURU
Oh, boo, bad boy! You scared him! Pretty, pretty fishy! Come on! boy!

YANN
Stop it, Auru! We have to go back up!

AURU
Heeey! Have you gone crazy or what? First we have to bury this lot! 

YANN
Auru! Quick! We have to go up! Give me that!

RAMANA
Yann, listen to me! You have to go down quickly and present the offering! That will appease the shark god!

PATRICK
Rubbish! Come back up sloooowly so you don’t get injured!

MARINA
Stop arguing, you two! “We have to respect the beliefs of others, even if we don’t share them!” Remember that, Uncle Patrick?

RAMANA
Of course! Why I didn’t think about that earlier? Yann, listen to me! It’s the moment to use the magical plants!

PATRICK
What?!

RAMANA
I repeat, use the herbs! Oh… It doesn’t work anymore!

AURU
I am the strongest! And I’m going to place the offering!

YANN
But you’re going up! Where are you going!? Auru! Come back! Watch the compression stops…

YANN
Ramana, you are our last hope…

AURU
hahaha Aoutch, my ear ! Huh ? What i'm doing here? Oh oh...

AURU
That’s strange, he looks very calm now!

YANN
Auru, forget it! I can do it! Auru, let me put the offering you don't look good.

AURU
I'm feeling much better.

YANN
Are you sure?

AURU
Yes!

YANN
So let’s go together!

MARINA
Wooow! Look at that!

PATRICK
Ahhh le vent se leve!

MARINA
Les nuages s'en vont, ca a marcher!

PATRRICK
They did it!

MARINA/PATRICK
Bravo!!

YANN
Thanks Zoom!

PAPA TUANAKU
The wrath of the shark god is now over! We are safe now! Thank you to you Ramana!

PAPA TUANAKU
You know, you are and you will be our shaman forever. 

TIMETI
I think Marina has a little gift for you.

MARINA
Look it’s brand new again!

RAMANA
Huh, thanks you Marina.

PAPA TUANAKU
The weather is nice again and it’s due to two courageous young men.

RAMANA
Hey guys, I want to thank you for having preventing me from leaving!

PATRICK
Did you really think we could dispense with the best shaman of the island?

RAMANA
So you believe in my mana?!

RAMANA
Patrick, you mean you believe in my power?

PATRICK
Uh… No I didn’t say that!

YANN
Here they go again...!

RAMANA
Patrick, you’re a good scientist, but you have to admit, I bring back the sun!

PATRICK
Yeah… Or maybe it… It could be just the meteo!

RAMANA
What?!
