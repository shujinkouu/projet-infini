With this improved drone, the person in distress could bring himself to the bar   .

TIMETI
and bring he or she back to shore…Good idea!

YANN
…Are you ready for the test, Auru? Let’s go!

AURU
Ready!

YANN
Okay!

YANN
It works!!

TIMETI
It works!!

AURU
Put me down shrimp!

YANN
Right now!

AURU
Aaaah! Hey!

TIMETI
Do something. Bring him back!

AURU
Help!

YANN
The drone is not responding anymore!

AURU
Ah, ah …ouh, ah, ah. Help ! No! I want to get back! 

YANN
Auruu!  No

TIMETI
Auruu!  No

BILL
Hey, there's the chief's kid chilling out…

RICO
Good for him! Concentrate on your net!

BILL
No! He's not chilling, he's out cold! We gotta save him!

BILL
Can you hear me? Wake up!

RICO
Aargh, this is gonna bring us trouble.

AURU
Aaah! Get away from me!

TIMETI
Biff? Rico? You…saved Auru!

YANN
I’m sorry, this is all my fault! You okay? How do you feel? 

RICO
Don't make a big deal about it. Take your buddy and beat it, we got fish to catch.

TIMETI
Surely you're not making him swim home?!

BILL
Don't worry, we'll take him home!

RICO
Okaaaay.

PAPA-TUANAKU
In the past we've had our differences. But today, you saved my son! Take these traditional necklaces as a token of my eternal gratitude.

AURU
Bravo!

MARINA
Yeah Blaise!

TAPUNA
Bravo!

YANN
Yeah!

MAEVA
Let's go eat! I've made a feast!

YANN
I’m really sorry… I was so scared, it could have been much worse…

AURU
Relax, Shrimp, I don't blame you. But next time you invent some gadget, include me out!

YANN
Well, after what happened today, I don't want to…

RICO
Well, no offense, but we gotta go. So, thanks a bunch!

TAPUNA
But you can't go back in the middle of the night! You'll spend the night with us.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Huh?!

AURU
Huh?

TAPUNA
They saved my Ruru! They've earned our hospitality!

BILL
What are you up to? No stealing anything, right? They trust us!

RICO
Don't worry, we'll do better than that!

YANN
Not now, Zoom. I need to fix the drone…

YANN
Jack's seaplane! We have to help him!

YANN
Hold on, Jack, we're coming!

RICO
Come on! Let’s go

JACK
Thanks guys

YANN
Uh… Okaaay… What happened there?

PAPA-TUANAKU
To Maotu's new heroes! Hurrah!

JACK
Thanks again! You get a ride in my plane any place you want to go! And there's no charge!

BLAISE
Yeaaaaaah! I love flying!

MAEVA
Auru and now Jack, you're real heroes!

RICO
No big deal, we couldn't let Jack drown.

TIMETI
A week ago, Biff and Rico couldn't set foot on Maotu and now they're the heroes of the atoll.

YANN
That's twice they've been in the right place at the right time…

AURU
Uh oh! You're jealous 'cos for once it's not you who's saving everybody!

YANN
That’s ridiculous! All I'm saying is the atoll is vast and I find it really weird they should be in the right place at the right time.

TIMETI
They saw him before you and they were faster, that's all. Anyway, I'm so happy to see that they’re good guys now.

MAEVA
Ahhh! Fire! Fiiiire!

RICO
Careful! Move aside.

MAEVA
Oh my… I‘m so lucky you were  around! Come by whenever you like and you’ll get all the chicken fafa you can eat!

BILL
Yeaaah!

RICO
Hmm, chicken… That's real generous of you!

YANN
Say, how did you manage to step in so fast? And why did you have extinguishers?

RICO
We… we just brought them for our boss' yacht. And we were passing and saw the fire. And… that's it. Okay, you coming?

TIMETI
A gas can… what's that doing here?

AURU
Okay, I think Yann is right. This is all beginning to smell fishy.

YANN
We need to ask Jack about his accident! 

RICO
Pff… What's the use of staging all these fake rescues if the only reward is chicken fafa!? It stinks and it's spicy… And I don't even like it! Why can't they give us some dough instead?!

BILL
So what we do? Go back and work for Van Krook?

BILL
I don't get it! Why are you sabotaging the boss'yacht?

RICO
Do I have to draw a picture!? We sabotage the engine, we go back to our boat and wait till the yacht's engine starts giving off smoke. And when Van Krook calls for help, bingo, we turn up and rescue him!

BILL
Ummm… yeah? Are you sure that’s a good idea?  

RICO
Of course  ! Better still, some DOUGH! Not stew and plane rides!

RICO
Where is the dingy?

BILL
Uh oh! I think I forgot to tie it up to the yacht!

RICO
You numbskull! The extinguishers are on the boat! How are we gonna…

BILL
I told you that it was a bad idea!  

VAN KROOK
Don't just stand there! Get the extinguishers and put the fire out!

RICO
Uh, well… the problem is that the extinguishers… are on our boat… Over there…

PATRICK
The cap to your gas tank is missing! That's why you lost your fuel.

JACK
Hmm, weird… that type of cap has a safety catch, it normally never comes unscrewed…

YANN
We have a problem; Zoom asks us to follow him!!

YANN
LOOK!

TIMETI
How are we going to get closer?

VAN KROOK
Help! Help! Save us!

PATRICK
We get the  cable so they can cross!

PATRICK
Yann, get closer, slowly. 

VAN KROOK
Do something! Quick, quick!

PATRICK
Stand clear!

VAN KROOK
Moi d'abord! Ahhhh… Ahhhhhh!

PATRICK
Come on, Van Krook….

YANN
Come on, you're nearly there! Next!

PATRICK
What are you doing? The cable won't support the two of you! The yacht is starting to sink!

YANN
Quick!

RICO
Ahhhh…..

BILL
I ain't roasting like a chicken!

YANN
Well done Zoom.

TIMETI
Yann use the drone. It is now or never.

YANN
No way! It might go wild again! 

PATRICK
Timeti is right, it’s the only way.

PATRICK
The yacht! It's dragging us down!

YAN
Okay. Biff, grab on to the bar! Quick!

JACK
Yeah!

AURU
Yeah! Now, that’s a real rescue. 

PATRICK
We'll need to patent that invention.

VAN KROOK
My yacht …

VAN KROOK
How could this happen? To me…

YANN
Ask Biff and Rico… I'm sure that they set fire to Maeva's place too… and sabotaged Jack's plane!

RICO
You ungrateful little brat! When we saved all of you here! You don't have any proof and…

BIFF
Oh stop it Rico! I liked to play superhero. Because of you  everybody hate us again now. and no more chicken fafaaaaa…

VAN KROOK
You… You… You're going to pay me back for the towing and repairs every cent!!

RICO
Huh?? But we'd have to work ten lifetimes to pay it all back!

PAPA-TUANAKU
You'd better not set foot on Maotu again!

RICO
We’re sorry.

BIFF
We’re sorry.

YANN
Right, Zoom, you're the only real super-hero on Maotu!

TIMETI
I'd say that you both are!
