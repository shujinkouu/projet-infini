CLARISSA
Salut les garcons, vous faites quoi?

YANN
Uh, hi, Clarissa. We're going kitesurfing. Do you want to come?

CLARISSA
Well… I…

AURU
Of course she's coming, Shrimp! Hey! Did you know that I'm a real ace at kitesurfing? I can show you a few tricks if you like!

CLARISSA
Oh? Really? I can’t wait to see that.

YANN
Hey, Timeti! Are you coming? We're going kite surfing…

TIMETI
That's nice of you, but no. Today, I've got the opportunity of my life!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Fellow villagers, as you know, all the shaman of the atoll gather every ten years for a special conference. And as the island cannot be left without a shaman, Ramana will appoint his replacement for the day… …his young lady replacement, I should say.

RAMANA
Well spoken. However, it is not I who will choose my replacement… but the spirits.

YANN
Uh… isn't he overdoing it a bit?
TIMETI
Shhhh!

AURU
Don't worry, you'll be chosen. Sure as eggs is eggs.

RAMANA
Spirits of Maotou, I call upon your wisdom! Speak to me! Guide me! Inspire me… and reveal the one who will protect our island!

YANN
Who? Me?

RAMANA
Yes, you! The spirits have chosen you. 

TIMETI
Ohhhh.

YANN
But Ramana! I don't know anything about shamanery!

RAMANA
Don't worry, my boy. You have an important part to play today. The role of village shaman has fallen to you! Il suffit que tu y crois et tout ira tres bien. 

YANN
Well, exactly, since you mention it…

RAMANA
And my apprentice can always assist you if there's a problem. So, good luck, see you tomorrow.

AURU
You okay, not too disappointed?

TIMETI
I’m fine… I’m fine… It's just that being shaman is very important. If Yann doesn't do things as he should, the village could face disaster.

FARATINA
Yann! I need a balm for my rheumatism. It's urgent!

YANN
A balm? I don't know how to prepare that!

FARATINA
The spirits chose you so you ought to know!

YANN
Okay, Faratina okay, I'll go see what I can do. But I'm not promising anything.

FARATINA
I hope Ramana is coming back soon! Because with this one, I am not ready to say goodbye to my rheumatism!

TAPUNA
Yann, my kitchen garden needs water! Don't forget the rain dance, huh?

YANN
A rain dance? But… but we're nowhere near the rainy season!

TAPUNA
Exactly! What else is a shaman for?

YANN
Uh, well, yes… if you say so…

INAPO
Hey, Yann! We need a blessing from the spirits before we go fishing. Can you do that?

YANN
Uh, okay…

FARATINA
All right, but first my balm! My back is killing me!

TAPUNA
And what about my vegetables? Are they supposed to grow by themselves?

INAPO
You want us to drown at sea without a blessing?

YANN
No, no, nooo!

YANN
A balm for the garden… Uh, no… A rain dance for rheumatism… No, that's not right…

TIMETI
Come on, cheer up, Yann. If the spirits chose you, it was for a reason. I'll help you.

YANN
Thanks, that's nice of you.

AURU
So can you lend your kite to Clarissa?

AURU
Cool! Thanks, Shrimp! Shall we go? I'm teaching you everything I know!

CLARISSA
Hahaha!

AURU
Yeaaaaaah!

CLARISSA
Not bad! My turn now! 

CLARISSA
Oh, didn't I tell you? I'm the kitesurfing junior world champion!

CLARISSA
I can show you a few tricks if you like?

AURU
Hehe.

YANN
drops of kaffir lime’s essential oil ; 4 drops of pure citronella extract and… done! Pfiouuu…

TIMETI
So Yann... Did you finish your balm against rheumatism already?

YANN
Tadaaa!

TIMETI
Arrggh! It’s smell really bad!

YANN
I don’t understand… I followed your book’s recipe!

TIMETI
Let’s see… But… It’s not the right page! You just made a balm to keep mosquitoes away!! You have to start all over again…

YANN
What?!

YANN
And may the spirits protect our sailors from storms, sharks, reefs and eels…

TIMETI
No, it's "storms, reefs" first and then "sharks and eels"!

YANN
But… that's what I said!

TIMETI
No way… You know, the wording must be recited accurately. The spirits are very fussy.

YANN
Ahhh...

YANN
Ouch! Aargh, I'll never do it! Anyway… …I don't believe in all this stuff!

TIMETI
Well, if you don't believe in it, it's certain you'll never manage it.

YANN
But I can't force myself!

TIMETI
But why didn't Ramana choose me? I spend my life studying shamanism, I know all the dances and rituals by heart. It would all have been simpler and given me the chance to prove myself. I can't believe the spirits don't consider me capable of this mission.

YANN
There's nobody in the world more capable than you for this mission, Timeti. I'm sorry, I know how important this is to you.

TIMETI
It's not your fault. The spirits must surely know what they are doing.

YANN
Here's your balm, Faratina. 

FARATINA
Oh thank you Yann! And how many times per day? Twice, I imagine?

YANN
Uh… Oh no, no way! Once is quite enough.

FARATINA
The smell is quite strong! Must be effective, you did a good job!

TIMETI
Come on, we'll go to the beach for the fishermen's blessing. Do you remember the incantation?

YANN
And may the spirits protect our sailors from storms, reefs, sharks and eels.

MAN
Yeah! Let’s go guys!

INAPO
Yeah!

TAPUNA
Do you think the rain god is more generous when he's shedding tears of laughter?

TIMETI
Could you start again, with, how can I put it… a tad more precision and conviction?

YANN
No, that's it! I’m fed up looking like a fool! I told you: I don't believe in this stuff. I've decided: I quit!

TIMETI
Yann… I think you've angered the rain god!

YANN
No, it's just a gust of wind! And if it gets worse and rains, that's just what you wanted, right?

TIMETI
Do not mock! The gods are sensitive and may take revenge by bringing disaster on us. We have to find a way to appease them.

YANN
Are you serious?

TIMETI
Come on, let's go to Ramana's shack. Maybe we can find the answer in his spell book for the chaos you've triggered!

YANN
But how can you see a curse in every breath of wind?

TIMETI
Ehhh...

YANN
Forgive me. Right, the best thing is for me to go back to the Galleon. That way I can't be blamed for causing more disasters.

TIMETI
Hey, come back here! You're the shaman!

YANN
Hi there! What are you doing?

PATRICK
Look, a force 8 gale is heading really fast for the island. It's most odd, it never happens at this time of year.

PATRICK
Is everything all right, Yann?

YANN
Uh… Yeah, sure!

PATRICK
Maybe we should warn the villagers so they can take shelter. Will you do that?

YANN
Okay.

YANN
A storm during this season? Do you think it's my fault?

YANN
No, it's all rubbish. Tropical storms do happen.

YANN
HEY, COME BACK! THERE'S A STORM COMING!

YANN
Rats, they can't hear a thing. Follow them Zoom!

YANN
You have to come back to the village! A storm's coming and…

AURU
Hm? What did you say shrimp? I can’t hear anything… AAAAAAHHHH! Noooo! Woooow!

CLARISSA
Ahhhhhhh!

YANN
Ooowo!

TIMETI
Forgiveness dance… Forgiveness dance… There, got it!

AURU
Heeeeeeeelp…

CLARISSA
Heeeeeeeelp…

CLARISSA
Move away!

YANN
Quick Zoom!

AURU
HEEEEELP! HEEEEEELP!

YANN
I’m coming!

TIMETI
Wait, it's too dangerous in this wind. The best thing is to perform the Forgiveness dance to appease the rain god.

YANN
We don't have time: they could fall at any moment!

AURU
AAAAAHHHH!! HELP

CLARISSA
AAAAAHHHH!! HELP

YANN
We have to get them down!

TIMETI
Yann! If we want to see our friends of the village, you have to listen to me. You're the shaman, Yann. You have to help me.

TIMETI
Now, recite this with me!

TIMETI
Spirits of Maotou, we honor and respect you. Your shaman begs and requests you to forgive him…

YANN
Spirits of Maotou, we honor and respect you. Your shaman begs and requests you to forgive him…

TIMETI
Spirits of Maotou, we honor and respect you. Your shaman begs and requests you to forgive him…

YANN
Spirits of Maotou, we honor and respect you. Your shaman begs and requests you to forgive him…

YANN
Hurray! Yeaaaah!

TIMETI
Hurray! Yeaaaah!

AURU
Yeah… If you could get us out of the tree now… That would be great!

YANN
Oh.. Huh.. Sorry, we’re coming!

PATRICK
We had a narrow escape. These tropical storms are unpredictable, but they stop as quickly as they start. Fortunately, because the village would never have withstood it.

RAMANA
My meeting was rather windy, but very instructive!

YANN
Hey Ramana! Here is your scepter. You know, it was nearly a disaster!

RAMANA
I know, I know, the spirits told me everything. They're crafty little imps, you know. They must have wished to test you and to make you both wiser.

RAMANA
I know you wanted the title of shaman, but you achieved something even greater: you transmitted your knowledge and opened up the mind of a friend, which is probably the hardest thing to do.

TIMETI
So, is it true? I opened up your mind? You admit there may be forces that can’t be scientifically explained? 

YANN
Well, uh… How can I put it? I was really surprised by the sudden appearance and disappearance of that storm, but you know… with global warming…

MARINA
You two really can't ever agree on anything! You're so sweet!

PATRICK
Hahahahaha!

YANN
Hahahaha!

RAMANA
Hahahaha!

TIMETI
Hahahahaha!

AURU
Hahahahaha!

MARINA
Hahahaha!
