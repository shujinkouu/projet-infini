PAPA-TUANAKU

MARINA
Yeah!

TAPUNA
It’is beautiful! And thank you, Maeva, for this delicious meal!

AURU
Yeah, yeah, it is great. Et maintenant, c'est l'heure des cadeaux! Joyeux anniversaire maman!

TAPUNA
Oh, thank you, Ruru! It’s absolutely magnificent!

AURU
I fished the pearls myself! 

MARINA
Ooooh!

AURU
It took me months to find such big ones!

PAPA-TUANAKU
And this is from me, my dearest!

TAPUNA
Oh, darling… You shouldn't have!

MARINA
Waaaaw!

YANN
Wait, get closer together! 

MARINA
Hihi

YANN
There, perfect! … Say cheese!

MARINA
Oh, Yann, will you lend me your camera? I want to take a photo of Tapuna's jewelry!

YANN
Sorry Marina, but I don't have many shots left. I want to keep them for the whole evening.

MARINA
Give a big smile, Raoul!

MARINA
Woooow! We look gorgeous!

MARINA
Look, Raoul! Don't you think Tapuna's jewelry look really great on me?

YANN
I don't believe it! Where can it be?

YANN
Marina!! Have you seen my camera? I can't find it anywhere!

MARINA
Huh? Uh… no, no, no...

YANN
Hmm… I must have left it at Maeva's. I'll go look!

YANN
Timeti? Auru? Have you seen my camera…

AURU
Well, we’ll see it later shrimp! My mother's jewelry has disappeared!

YANN
What???

AURU
My Dad's furious. He's turning the whole village upside down. You wouldn't have seen them, would you?

YANN
No!

TIMETI
Two disappearances the same night… That can't be a coincidence…

AURU
Of course not. There's a thief on the island and he'd better not let me get my hands on him!

MARINA
Yann mustn't find this photo, Raoul! Or he'll think that it was me who took his camera!

TIMETI
Marina! What are you doing?

MARINA
Me? Nothing!

AURU
Are you hiding something?

MARINA
Huh? It's… it's not true!

YANN
What! But… this is a photo taken by my camera! You lied to me, Marina!

AURU
There, my mother's jewelry! Where did you put it?

MARINA
Put what?

AURU
Don't play innocent! You stole it, didn't you?

MARINA
What?! But that's not true. I didn't steal anything at all!

YANN
Hold on a second, you can trust her. Marina would never do that. She's not like that.

AURU
Hmmm… Yeaaah… Okay… But I'm watching you! Come on We have to find my mother's jewelry! It’s got to be somewhere!

MARINA
How can they think it was me! It is such nonsense!

MARINA
What’s that…?  Well done, my big boy! You are the champ! Lala, lala, lala, lala.

YANN
Marina… How could you do this?

AURU
So, you said you were not a thief?

MARINA
But… But I just found it on the ground!

AURU
Give us a break! Where’s the rest of the jewelry?

MARINA
But I don't know!

AURU
In that case, I have no choice: I shall have to talk to my father.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Marina, you know that theft is a very serious wrong on the island!

MARINA
Yes, I know. But-I-am-not-a-thief.

TAPUNA
My dear, if you tell us where the jewelry is, I promise we'll forget this whole thing.

MARINA
Hmmph.

PATRICK
The jewelry has certainly disappeared, but there's no proof that Marina is the guilty one!

AURU
Hold on! She took a photo of herself with the jewelry just before it disappeared and we found her with one of the ear rings! I don't know what more proof you need!

PATRICK
Well, I propose Marina remains at the Galleon until she tells us where she's hidden it.

MARINA
What?! But that's not fair!

PAPA-TUANAKU
It's not very nice to lie, Marina.

MARINA
Mmmmm.

PATRICK
I'm sorry, I don't know what came over her! Compte sur moi pour regler cette affaire au plus vite.

MARINA
Out of my way, Zoom! Nobody believes me! I just took a little photo with Raoul… And now every body hates me!

RICO
Heh, heh! Now we've all we need to take some fine photos!

BILL
Ahhh, yeah and it's sparkly too. I really like sparkly stuff!

MARINA
They are certainly talking about Tapuna's jewelry! I am sure Biff and Rico are the thieves!

MARINA
Come on, Raoul. I'll prove that I'm innocent! Zoom, don't say a word…

BILL
I'll be right back, I'm going to fetch another net. Tum, tum, ta tum!

MARINA
Fiou! Ooooh!

RICO
Mmmm.

PAPA-TUANAKU
Marina!!

TAPUNA
Marina!!

PATRICK
Marina!!

MAEVA
Marina!!

AURU
Marina!!

TIMETI
Marina!!

MARINA
You’re the thieves!

BILL
Well, of course! And proud of it!

RICO
What exactly are you talking about, kid? We steal so much stuff…

MARINA
Tapuna's jewelry and my brother's camera!

MARINA
I heard you! You talked about taking photos and sparkly things!

RICO
You mean our latest generation new cell phone?

MARINA
But if it wasn't you, who was it?

RICO
No idea, kiddo and it ain't our problem! Now, beat it!

YANN
Marina?! Are you there?

YANN
Marinaaaaa!!!

YANN
Zoom, do you know where she is?? Show me!

MARINA
Raoul, now it's certain: I'm going to be punished forever…

MARINA
Wha… what's happening?

MARINA
Aaah, the canoe's alive!

MARINA
Yaaaaan! Help meee!

YANN
Marina! We have to help her!

MARINA
Au secours! Yann depeche toi!

YANN
But what's happening?

MARINA
I don't knoooow! My canoe has gone crazy!

YANN
Don't move, I'll go look.

YANN
Incredible! It was a coconut crab pulling on your canoe's mooring line. And he has my diving mask

YANN
Let’s see what they are doing!

MARINA
I wonder where they will bring the bottle and your mask!

MARINA
Tapuna's necklace! And there, the other ear ring! You see: I wasn't lying!

YANN
My camera! It's totally ruined…

MARINA
So, the crabs are the island's thieves?

YANN
Sorry, Marina, I should have believed you… even if you should have asked me before borrowing…

MARINA
True, But the crabs too!

PATRICK
Yann, Marina! We were looking for you everywhere!

YANN
Look what we found! The coconut crabs hid them with loads of other things!

PATRICK
Ha, ha, of course, coconut crabs are kleptomaniacs.

MARINA
Kleptomaniacs?

PATRICK
Yes, it means they steal everything they find. They're also very strong and can steal things weighing nearly kilos!

TIMETI
Do you have anything to say to Marina?

AURU
Uh… What I meant was… sorry Marina.

PAPA-TUANAKU
In the name of the whole village, I beg you to forgive us for having falsely accused you, Marina!

TAPUNA
Oh, my dear, I am so sorry! We should have believed you! Here, to make amends, I'll lend you my necklace.

MARINA
Yippee! You see this, Raoul!?

AURU
Aaaah! Ooooh! Raoul!!

YANN
Aaaah! Ooooh! Raoul!!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Aaaah! Ooooh! Raoul!!

TAPUNA
Aaaah! Ooooh! Raoul!!
