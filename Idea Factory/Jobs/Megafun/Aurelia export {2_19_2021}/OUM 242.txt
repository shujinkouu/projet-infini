Raouul!! Raouul!!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I promise that if you ever come near Maotu again, you'll be sorry!  I’ll go alert the Coast Guards. Can you watch this scoundrel till they come to get him? 

PATRICK
And yet we told you not to get close to this criminal. You're very lucky it ended well…

TIMETI
Now that there's no more danger, can we go look for the Sunken City?

PATRICK
I'm not sure… You really deserve to be grounded.

YANN
Oh, please! You can ground me as much as you like after!

PATRICK
Hmmm… Very well. But, be sure…

YANN
Thank you Uncle Patrick

TIMETI
Thank you Uncle Patrick

AURU
Thank you Uncle Patrick

PATRICK
…to be careful.

YANN
The city should be somewhere in this area.

AURU
It’s crazy, we will be the first to discover it!

TIMETI
We're going to see the Sunken City of Mofa'ana… I can't believe it…

YANN
Hmmm… We mustn't get carried away: finding underwater ruins won't be easy…

AURU
Aaaaw… What a kill-joy he is! Come on! Let's go get that Trident!

PATRICK
Hmmm… there's been a surge in seismic activity in the atoll…

MARINA
"Seismic activity", what does that mean?

PATRICK
That the earth is quaking slightly on the coasts of Maotu. But, don't worry, they're not major movements. However I’d better call my colleagues. 

JEAN-SEBASTIAN
Raoul

PATRICLE
Raoul! John Sebastian! You two calm down!

AURU
Aargh, where is this city? It should be obvious. It's not as if we are hunting for a winkle!

YANN
Let’s hope there's something left.

PATRICK
Hello! Do you read me? My seismograph is showing alarming data. What about yours? Hello! Do you read me?

MARINA
Raoul! Look what you did? Raoul come back here now!

YANN
I don't believe it! It is here!

TIMETI
It's magnificent… to think that it was so close from Maotu and we never found it… 

YANN
The ocean is so vast… if you don’t know where to look, it’s almost impossible to find ruins. Even closed to the coast.

AURU
Ouah! A Taoora tiki It’s the same than the one in the Mangrove!

MARINA
Bad Raoul! Hum?

MARINA
Uncle Patrick! Uncle Patrick!

PATRICK
Oh … My head .. What happened? Good grief. He escaped! 

PATRICK
Yann! Yann! Do you read me? Reldan escaped. Yann? He must be too deep.

YANN
Zoom, I think we're going to need your help!

TIMETI
The Trident of Mofa'ana!

AURU
It's even more beautiful than I imagined…

YANN
Stop! It may trigger some mechanism, we must be careful!

RELDAN
That's right, leave it to the grown-ups!

YANN
No Zoom, don’t’ move. 

RELDAN
Smart thinking, because I won't hesitate to fire!

TIMETI
Leave it!

RELDAN
You think I will renounce to an antique that must be worth millions? Dream on!

TIMETI
You see? Gods begin to move!

RELDAN
Phooey, superstition! It's a seismic shock…

YANN
Zoom, No!

RELDAN
Stay back!

TIMETI
We triggered the anger of the Gods!

YANN
It must be a seismic shock.  

AURU
Or the power of the Trident!

PATRICK
Is everybody okay? Luckily, you left me your diving co-ordinates!

YANN
Reldan has the Trident!

PAPA-TUANAKU
The Trident of Mofa'ana?

PATRICK
What's all this about a trident?

YANN
We'll explain later! We mustn't let him get away!

RELDAN
Them again!

TIMETI
The Trident! Did you see what it can do?

PATRICK
I'd say that it was more likely a rogue wave. There's intense seismic activity in the area… We need to get back to the village.

YANN
And Reldan? And the Trident? 

PATRICK
He is way too far, Yann. Let’s go home. I have a bad feeling….

PATRICK
Don't worry about your trident. Stolen antiques are always recovered when they get resold. And so are the thieves.

TIMETI
I hope so…

PATRICK
Oh!

PAPA-TUANAKU
Oh! 

PATRICK
Oh no…

PATRICK
Quand l'eau se retire de cette facon, ca annonce generalement…tidal wave!! We have just enough time to grab a few things and get to safety inland! Hurry, there's not a second to lose! Marinaaaaa!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I'll go warn the villagers.

RAMANA
Something very serious has happened! Taaora is very angry!

TIMETI
It's Reldan! He stole the Trident!

YANN
And a tsunami arose right after!

RAMANA
There can be no doubt. Taaora is inflicting on us the same punishment he meted out to King Mofa'ana and his people.

TIMETI
What if we recovered the Trident and returned it to its place?

AURU
What?! Are you crazy!? We have to leave with the others. That's our only chance!

YANN
It looks like he wants to catch up with Reldan!

RAMANA
Hmm, with a little luck that might calm the wrath of Taaora, yes

PAPA-TUANAKU
Only take what is strictly necessary Come on, faster! Take the little path!

PAPA-TUANAKU
I said what is ‘strictly necessary’!

TAPUNA
Did you expect me to leave Aunt Vaiata's tea service behind?! It was her wedding present!

PATRICK
Les enfants ne sont pas avec toi?

PAPA-TUANAKU
Well, no. I thought they were with you!

PATRICK
Oh!

AURU
He's trying to go around the wave!

AURU
Stoooop

RELDAN
You are real leeches..

AURU
A l’abordage

TIMETI
Stop

RELDAN
You gonna let it go!

TIMETI
Never

AURU
Don't move or I'll send you down to the crabs!

YANN
We don't have time to get back to Maotu. Si on veut calmer Tahora, We have to return the Trident to its place, NOW! But there is only one tank and it’s almost empty….

TIMETI
So, I'm the one to go, I'm the best swimmer of us three!

YANN
I'm the best free-diver. I stand the best chance.

TIMETI
But Yann…

YANN
You have to trust me. I promise that I'll come back safe!

PATRICK
Wait! The wave has fallen back! The village is saved!

PAPA TUANAKU
Hurray! sorry

TAPUNA
We are saved! Hurray!

MAN
Hurray!

RAMANA
The spirits have calm down! The kids did it!

AURU
He did it! I can't believe it! The Shrimp pulled it off!

TIMETI
I hope he will have enough oxygen to get back now…

TIMETI
Please Taaora. Yann replaced the Trident, he needs your assistance…

TAPUNA
You can fix it now!

PAPA TUANAKU
With pleasure Darling!

COPS
I hope you enjoyed the walk, because, now for you it’s back to jail.

PATRICK
I'm so happy to see you back! I had the fright of my life!

AURU
I wanted to keep that Trident so much! Je sais, on doit pas se prendre pour un dieu, c'est mal.

YANN
Well, all I saw was some perfectly explicable seismic activity.

AURU
What about the Giant tiki that buried itself, how do you explain that?

PATRICK
It's quite possible a fault opened under the sand and swallowed it up. That would also explain why the wave fell back…

TIMETI
Or maybe Taaora didn't want us to find the Trident again…

YANN
Hey, Zoom, what do you think? Magic or seismic?
