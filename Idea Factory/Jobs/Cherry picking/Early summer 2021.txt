Ok so first we picked for Raj and Naj Brar I picked for 400$ worth somewhere around that, sadly our experience ended terribly with the guy
Raj accusing us of all the troubles of the world and accusing us of lying and stealing from him. All that to say that I refused to get payed
and gave him back his money in silver 2 days later.
Next we went to Charlie for some sort picking, lots of burnt tree but we went throught it I only picked for 150$ worth there.
