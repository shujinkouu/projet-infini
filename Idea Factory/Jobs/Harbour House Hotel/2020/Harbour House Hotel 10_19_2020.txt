I'm now kind off the manager when the manager isn't there,

some area of focus would be going faster controlling my mind wandering during the day
and controlling my temper as well as becoming more disciplined, so far so good this job 
seems to be going fantastic.

Some passive things I should do is plastifying the different positive message from the clients and give
extreme ownership to ismael
