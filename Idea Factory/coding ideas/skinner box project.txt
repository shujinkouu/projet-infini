the idea is to make a skinner box game where one gets slowly addicted to the game

The game would be based on the book by b.f skinner schedules of reinforcements
quote could be used making the player more and more aware of the innevitability of what is happening
the idea is to then offer the schedule of reinforcements which b.f skinner also demonstrated
