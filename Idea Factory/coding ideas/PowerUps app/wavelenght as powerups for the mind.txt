So in mario bross you can pickup a mushroom and have anhenced ability to destry rocks with your head and survive 1 damage and whatnot

in reality when you listen to music it gives you a similar powerup where you can do better things you have better moral you can
sync your action with the melody or the rythm for example and be more organize and go faster that way, it is a powerup for your mind
similarly when you listen to a podcast it enables you to learn while doing something else.

sadly in reality these powerup powers are inneffective if used a lot in a row like for example if you listen to the same album in a row
after 8 hours it doesn't have the same effect, same for odcast evne if the podcast is different after 3 podcast of 2 hours, you're not
really learning from the 4th.
