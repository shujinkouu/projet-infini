So the app idea is to enable the user to organize his powerups for the day, so you have the media pool in the background,
of that pool you'd pickup 3 album let's say as well as 2 podcast for a day

you'd be limited to those for 24 hours for a day and you'd get new ones every single day.
you can fine tune the rate of return of those power ups as well as how many you can have every da of each kind.

you can use relaxing sounds too like nature sounds ect. as a powerup
