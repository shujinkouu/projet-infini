connected to ths other idea of powerups I always wanted to study the effect of unrelated background noise on the brain.
alone in a rainy forest/lake for example vs an action serie playing in the background. For sure there is a response to those
auditive cues what is it and how can we compare them. 

In my opinion and if I had to make bets and prediction I would say that nature sounds are good and action series in the background are bad
that is true if thituation is not controlled and repeats across time
