I don't understand what good man who work all day to figure out a way out of the inflation imposed on us for our immediate family and surroundings are supposed to do,
 "getting involved" sounds silly when you work all day to pay the bills. Ok I read the end of it so if one of my friend shows signs -> what do I do, instruction 
unclear got my dick stuck in the toaster or worse ... I think we should talk to those guys there is a way out of the predicament. To me the way out doesn't look like 
projecting our vision of the problem on them tho. I can't see how that can do much more than axaccerbate everything, they probably get some ammount of projection 
already and probably feel it. All that to say: problem is deeper and we gotta dig deeper, simplistic solution don't solve problems. As I said the other day we've 
now spent almost 10 year collectively talking about the problem, one of both side clearly won the persuasion game, resolution is still low, we're not gonna make it 
that way or at least I don't think so. It would be done already. #killallmen seems like the logical conclusion of most of these. It is actually my solution in 
similar seeming situation or at least if formulated the same, 1 in 10 of gmo fruits are poison first solution that comes to mind, avoid the whole bunch. 
1 in 10 women will divorce you with half your salary as free lunch solution: mgtow. 1 in 10 woman is mean to you solution hate them all, it goes on and on. 
We have to get better at thinking about those issues there's no way out with the current template.
