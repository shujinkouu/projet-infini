making money from everything\\

so we have access to a solder and solder paste but we have no filament
this needs to be acquired, and to arrive at that point, I have the fancy, to have a plan, to make money using said solder.

The purpose for this whole soldering rig in the first place is 
-To get a new kit going
-To solder stuff

Thus the only way to make money with a cheap soldering rig is, to solder stuff
the stuff we we'll be soldering and needing this rig for is fixing our two charging cable for laptop.

but how is making money from soldering even possible. I'll posit that here and let the water settle on the issue.

thousands or options are possible I am sure
