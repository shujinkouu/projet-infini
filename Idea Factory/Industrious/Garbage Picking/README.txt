we got a python map somewhere I don't remember how it's called but it is meant as the very first draft of this app, Benevolence App
Garbage picking section 

for now we do have mixed info map spots of picking
pics of garbage picked 
text description of garbage picked and or session of picking
dates, ect...

The idea is to centralized all those info to track our picking progress
