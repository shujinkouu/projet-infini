we wre thinking many different spots, the okanagan is in need of bread

ossoyos as no bread oliver either
saltspring has no bread location is 150k$

ok falls as no food and is a passerby town
our target right now is ok falls considering the cheapness of the spot and te real need for food there

thus prices at okfalls need to be checked :)
