ok so 2 things are primary

butter
flour

water
yeast
yeast are created through flour

secondary
ham
eggs
cheese:parmesianno reggiano

bagette:
yeast
flour
water

->sandwichiffy
    ham
    butter
        ->upgrade
        cheese

croissant:
flour
yeast
water
butter

->sandwichiffy
    cheese
    eggs


that's two bagette sandwich
1 croissant sandwich

coffee can easily be added on top !

so
2 primary product
3 derivative
1 coffee
optional is selling the parts that's 6
for a theoretical maximum of 12 items taking only that into account

this is why the original strategy:
to not get lost in the weeds lets only focus on two primary things
croissant and bagette those need to be godly

steps toward this goal is 
finding flour and butter near location
