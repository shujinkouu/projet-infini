on natural flavours

natural flavours are in everything but what is it ?
according to internet something like 80 different substance can be sold under the name natural flavours list list is graciously provided on the fda website.

Every item that is allowed, when searched, leads to a perfume of the specific flavour.
For mint by example I believe pine needles are used, for mango it is the leaf of the tree, for almond the pits of cherries.
My goal would be to have an exhaustive list of all the allowed ingredients, as well as, the link to their respective flavour.

One thing is for sure the only way to avoid eating pine needle and other random stuff added for flavour is to avoid natural flavour altogheter. Hopefully the coming breakdown will help deciding which flavour are worse and which are better for health, as well as, answer some curious question. Which one is the most surprising? Which one is the most shady? and others.
