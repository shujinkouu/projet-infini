The hierarchy itself is not established or changed from the point of view of morality, nevertheless an action is judged moral or immoral based on the prevailing determination.

This is a part of the justification for the folly of our age, only a little reordering makes it clear
if the hierarchy is not established or changed with morality, than what changes it ?
nevertheless our action are judged moral or immoral based on our determination

Therefore one can topple the hierarchy morally
as long as the prevailing determination is good the action will be judged moral.

The obvious answer for what changes a hierarchy would be the will to power. Not power but the will to it.
Power would be taking the arms and seizing the means
the will to power means whatever it will take to end up at the spot, including being nice and working dilligently in harmony with others.
There is no faster way to change or establish a hierarchy than with a low friction solution.
Power seems like the highest friction possible to enact change,
the will to power is by definition the lowest friction possible to enact change.

To be powerful a human needs to be usefull to it's entourage and reliable 

A despot is only as powerful as his strongest weapon, wheareas someone in disposition of the real means to power is as poweful as nature is strong.

I got this bit out because it might help current quandry people believe that raw power is the means, that morality is the means.
Hierarchy aren't built either on raw power or on morality they are built and changed throught determined will.
