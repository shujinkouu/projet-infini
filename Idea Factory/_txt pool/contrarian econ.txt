I remebered this old thesis of mine I spitted that out in primary school I believe,
the more ads there is on thing the less people will buy of that thing.
Obviously from the vantage point of age it is obvious this thesis is wrong, yet there remains a kernel of truth.
Contrarian economics.
In fact there is a whole class of our society the contrarians maybe other class too for which this initial statement does apply,
other advertisement channel are made especially for these, such as podcast advertising ect... 
A product can therefor be a maintstream product, a contrarian product or simply an essential good which we'll all recognize as something worth purchasing even tho there really is no add for it.
