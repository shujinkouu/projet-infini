The only way to do science is the institutional way, that's false. Anyone with instinct can make new discoveries. Papers don't make anyone smart. I have more, peer review is a mechanism for social conformism.

Anyone with instinct can come to any old conclusion based on anecdotal evidence and will believe it vehemently for the rest of their lives. A lone wolf can’t verify that they have good data without collaborating and consulting with others who understand their field of study

Except Nikolas Tesla was a lone wolf for one and he made the electric motor .... Clearly everyone who uses adominem are not exactly scientist either. Yes data must be verified but the verification process has now engulfed the actual endeavour. Anyway truth will prevail even if it starts with a minority of one. Galileo wasn't exactly liked by the community either.

Tyler James I agree with your point btw but consulting with peers and peer review aren't synonymes. And yes you can verify some things yourself, senses organ are actually quite accurate tools.

Tyler James And I'm not saying all instinct are right either that is your projection, I am saying discoveries comes from great insight as well as the instinct to explore in unknown and weird direction. Yet also requires the willingness to assert the contrary, make the hypothesis and do the experiment to check who'm is right. The instinct to generate the right experiment isn't trivial either as it is probably the most difficult part of the whole process (If you allow me to ignore the institutionnal framework for a minute). In fact some great geniuses came out of nowhere and my claim is that there would be more of them if we didn't kill them from the get go.

I don't do The science, I do science, or more precisely alchemy as I rarely actually note the stuff down. Yet if stuff works how can it be stupid, I am actually eager to have conversation about such things, you guys seem eager to be right and put me in some box with a label. Tuff luck. I still believe what I believe in if you want to attack it from a more rationnal point of view I am ready for it, I gave you guys some concession (such as instinct not being always right) which was implicit in the original statement. Check where stuff makes sense, check where there's a bit that is right and you'll understand what I am saying. Then we can talk about the inconsistency all you want.

The allusion that you need a phd to do research is revulsive to me, I know tons of smart people who do their research yet have no phd. I also know phd's and those two guys can agree on their research as well as quote the same valid articles, how baffling and impossible according to the point of view defended.
