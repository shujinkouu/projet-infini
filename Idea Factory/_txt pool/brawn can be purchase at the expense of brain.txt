this is an idea, people in montreal for example are thinking about how leaders are poorly using 
their skills and use servant for menial reppetitive or worse harmful tasks.

The old focus, which is also my focus is to learn to be a servant and to produce goods
by being a good servant I can serve effectively

I was then thinking about people being good servant all their life never getting ahead 
they are enabling the generation after them to get ahead. My study is of how we can achieve such goals

the study of the critical types are of how to dismantle the current system where are it's weaknesses how to attack and
disrupt it both in reality disrupting physical structure but also in people disrupting their own putting together of the
situation. when such goals will realize themselves and they will those people that are taking part of it will realize 
that there is nothing else, goods have to come from somewhere so we must have to work to produce them.

Bisarely stemming from jealousy or personnal gain but it has no perspective no recul, only parts are seen no the whole
(gestalt for more precise, thanks german :) )

To me there can be only one focus and that's the one of being a good servant but also more importantly how to be a good master
of oneself, how do we make this system 1 work 2 be fun 3 be interactive and fulfilling 4 be moral 5 be worthwhile
those are questions that needs asking not a scale but to ourselves
