goal is new insights
we targeting the maps right now in python

Beautifull soup local documentation: file:///C:/Users/Asus/Documents/food%20search/archiver%20Research/archiver/BeautifulSoup/www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/index.html
all the work is located in : C:\Users\Asus\Desktop\OpenLayer\.

first goal of displaying a map was achieved by using the python module webview
url = https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/accessible.html
webview.create_window("name of the window", url)
webview.start()

We now need to figure out if we can project data on top of those maps and synchronise current position
with gps data or with adress ect.
Ok we are stuck on opening a local file using pywebview I have no idea why and other peple are having success with it

first working example right there:
this is using beautiful soup to parse the raw html data and feed it to a webview projector. This works perfect right now
the next step is to feed the html file into beautiful soup instead of feeding the raw html

>>> html_doc = """<!doctype html>
... <html lang="en">
...   <head>
...     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openlayers/openlayers.github.io@master/en/v6.5.0/css/ol.css" type="text/css">
...     <style>
...       .map {
...         height: 400px;
...         width: 100%;
...       }
...     </style>
...     <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/openlayers/openlayers.github.io@master/en/v6.5.0/build/ol.js"></script>
...     <title>OpenLayers example</title>

...   <body>
...     <h2>My Map</h2>
...     <div id="map" class="map"></div>
...     <script type="text/javascript">
...       var map = new ol.Map({
...         target: 'map',
...         layers: [
...           new ol.layer.Tile({
...             source: new ol.source.OSM()
...           })
...         ],
...         view: new ol.View({
...           center: ol.proj.fromLonLat([37.41, 8.82]),
...           zoom: 4
...         })
...       });
...     </script>
...   </body>
... </html>"""

*Nvm way too complicated and even once we get it to work we'll have to pay with the scale
we'll use google for now
getting the google api key: 

new packages:
-bookeh
https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html
-jupyter
https://jupyter.org/documentation
-pandas
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
-pywebview
https://pypi.org/project/pywebview/
this is a very powerful module it can display any webpage within python
we'll try using this to display an OpenLayer map
