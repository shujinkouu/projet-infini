ok so working for Ro today, it's 1.15pm rn she gave me an episode of gorgia and went to the store
I'll be working in the meantime :) (meantime has now become 2 hours and running it could've been nice to have goten a truthfull answer from the getgo, would've been easier to work and would've asked for more work probably I don't have the impression that the lead is focused on mission success but more on the getting stuff from the store and even then 2 hours is a bit much to get stuff from a store working in such untruthful context builds resentment and doesn't fester a good working environment)
ok it is now 1.51pm I am done the work I was given ! I'll be in chomage technique till the leads come back
welp I am pretty bored at the moment it is 2.32pm ... -> 3.06pm -> 4.19pm -> 4.35pm

I am basically working on this project alone at this point almost 4 hours without seeing the lead, is she even alright no idea, one thing for sure 4 hours is not soon and this project isn't getting done today 

welp I'm done my job it's 8.51pm right now, lead came back and gave me a second episode (larger than the first to clean) now she is finishing the job on her episode which I do find quite admirable if she can manage it.
