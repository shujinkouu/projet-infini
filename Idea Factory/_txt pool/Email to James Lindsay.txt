Hi James,
This is a reply to your apprent cry for help, on the podcast with Jonhatan Pageau towards the end, apparently you need 10 more of you. I was, for some reason, under the impression that you carried an army of interpret with you, bearing the skill that you do have, I was mistaken in this respect. I can interpret and have interpreted to my friends and family the lunacy that is being carried in school and elsewhere, I will help you in this respect. As to my context, it matters little, yet it  still does so here are bullet points, I live in Canada, quit school at cgep level in Quebec (I am french canadian), I quit specifically because of the standard curriculum, the class that you have to have, such as marxism, as you well know. Right now at this moment I am out of a job until cherry picking in June, which is a reunion. I was manager of housekeeping at an hotel not long ago and was wrongly terminated after a sudden change in management (aka they said I gave my demission and lied), and as the famed Rowan did, I can carry a message to Garcia. 
From what I understand, you have the will, a guiding star you see, I therefore, render my sword unto you.

Cordially,
Jean Merlier
