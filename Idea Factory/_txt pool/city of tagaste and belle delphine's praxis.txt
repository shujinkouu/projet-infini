belle delphine's praxis, queer theory and the burning of the teddy bear

in her videoclip touring the collection of dildo she has, she then burns a teddy bear, this is exactly representative of queer theory's praxis idea of attacking childhood innocence, here represented by the teddy bear burning, interposed by images of large dicks and plastic penises. The whole of the belle delphine exercise can then be described according to such therm, in her own word the goal is to represent tease for a period of time and, then shift to straight porn. This escalation helps onboarding, grabbing the innocent attention and directing it in a peculiar way as to bring it to spend money on porn merch. This bridges quite awesomely with the city of tagaste, which is the city you are now likely inhabiting. This mystical city described by Helbert Hubbard, is one where you can find books everywhere and in quantity, it illustrate the idea of quantity over quality and is a city where the once prosperous becomes rubble throught the promotion and monetization, especially the gear towards trying to appeal to increasingly depraved twisted and generally bad human taste.
