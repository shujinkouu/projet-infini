I figured out how to get most of our files back from services this leads to knowing how to download from most sites as well.
Here's how.

First you'll need a browser,
Chrome, firefox, brave, explorer, anything will do.
Second go on your site such as facebook for example this is where I first used this.
Now right click select inspect element, a tab will open with the html code for the facebook page, in there you have tabs up top from which you can select "Network"
do that!

Now you are in the Network tab of the inspect element of your browser, from there you'll be able to see the internal trafic of the site!
Now to download a .mp3 find a audio message you have on facebook and click play.
You'll see that at that moment an .mp3 appears in the network tab, this is your file and you can download it by right clicking and opening in a new tab!

Now how does this leak to other application, twofolds 
first fold, on some website such as some streaming website this will allow you to directly download the videos you're streaming.
second fold, on other more well protected site you'll thus have access to an .m3u8 file and a bunch of .ts files.
Now here is how this works the .ts files each contain 2seconds of your video and the .m3u8 is a file which knits all these .ts together so you get to see your video.
By copying the address of the .m3u8 you can thus download the video, using vlc for example.
To do that using vlc which is slow, media->open network stream {paste the link here} (this allows you to play it in vlc)-> then using convert/save option you can ave it locally careful because it is very slow.
Now you only need an .m3u8 downloader to go faster such as  "Vovsoft - m3u8 downloader" which works great. Happy life !
