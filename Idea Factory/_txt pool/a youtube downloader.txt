A youtube downloader replacement,

coding the gui will be the first and foremost part since our downloader already works
we need an input field and a button

txt should be entered as so in then input field
url1
url2
url3
url4
ect..

uppon clicking the button, we take the values in the input field
and convert them to a list
['url1','url2','url3','ect']
then we can simply download the list using dl(list) which is what our whole downloader is

by default this will download on the selected path 
maybe we can host it inside a folder and create a output file then use that as the location

first steps first tho
