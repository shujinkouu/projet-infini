In fact I prefer making 1$ walking for 2 hours in the wood picking up aluminum cans than making 100x as much working 8 hours everyday for a minimum wage job

It is more work indeed, but it turns out some people prefer to work in such a way :). I'm not in the nft space because it isn't real investments, yet I still am working pretty hard at understanding and managing my assets ! It is more work yes, but it's more fun
