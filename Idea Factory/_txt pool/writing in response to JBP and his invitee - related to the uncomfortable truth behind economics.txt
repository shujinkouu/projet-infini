ok so I was listening to, a podcast by JBP, the uncomfortable truth behind econ, ther is a book recommendation somewhere at the start,

then around 20 comes the meat of what I have to say, I do agree with Eric Weinstein that any solution for female/man income needs to discuss interest but also pay attention to difference per occupation which is directly an economic problem, ie you can fix 4 cars but you can't fix half a broken person in a day. This needs some observing as well as the fact that women get differentially rewarded traditionnaly for their occupation as care giver in some other ethereal currency which is represented in the memory of the person in their entourage, if this collective memory be interpreted as a bank account for a second and the unit has memory, good memory some other people have of you, bad memory counting as credit, then according that scenario woman would have a tremondous + over men, within a single generation, but more especially accross generations. So if the monetary aspect gets equalized it then creates a new assymetry, which in turn destabilize our homeostatic system, changing therefore the dynamics of pressures inside our cultural, and communal as well as societal fluid.
Using such tool as analysis I would also go and push back on the invitee, selling us equality, equality in a homeostatic system with tension is death, if the tension disappears in this system the energy goes to 0 and entropy ultimately wins without a fight. If any part of the equation gets equalized than the potential energy will move to another part of the system in sometimes unpredictable ways, if such forces converge they can create a tear in the fabric which in turn create leaks of fluid which since it carries the energy, must be addressed. Equality is not a virtue, you could say freedom is and freedom is equality before nature, as powerless being with a spark of genius and therefore a chance. Equality in this way doesn't lead to similar outcome, yet one can still hold the position that caregiving salaries needs to augment and I do believe studies on the unpercieved externality of undervaluing those areas are on their way to revolutionnize our way of thinking about these things. In fact fixing yourself physically spiritually mentally is as important as fixing your car if let's say your goal is to go about your day and work, a car with problem will do, as well as a physicality, spirituality of mentality with problem will do, but a broken car or person needs immediate attention else the work can't go on. 
With such angle we can also clearly see problems in our way of living, this barebone, reservoir 1/10 full mentality won't cut it for another 100 year. This ties back to our point about homeostatic system and equality being problematic, what we want in fact is inequality, we all want power but we don't want everyone with the same power, we all want power in our sphere, if I reside in the sphere of fixing car, I want the power to have all the tools buy all parts, makes new part and jerry rig things, I want the lifts the locations the wit to find new market, I want power to expand and power to help people. But if you are fixing people you don't need this power, you want to house them to feed them to make them laugh to influence their thinking positively to talk to them to care for them and about them and their lives, to search for more of these people and help them too you want the power to expand to other location and form institution bridging different people each helping in their own ways, you want that power for yourself. All those power are different, they all contain money as a part yet aren't money, but you certainly don't want equality, equality leads to too many errors to be considered a virtue. Equality in freedoms is a consequence of the right input to the system, those inputs are principles. Therefore you want the right principles, and equality can't be one, else the nurse ends up with the tools and the mecanics ends up with the institution, or both with such a small fraction of each that it is negligible, when equality is a principle in fact no ones ends up with anything, because equality works to equalize, it doesn't produce the lifting force, the thrust, it doesn't charge the particule in your fluid, instead it looks at differences, anchors to particule with force and works to bring them down by formalizing, opposing an equal force to them to bring them within the mean. The principle I propose in exchange, is to "mind your business" which is in fact iconic of american culture and figures on the "fuugo" coins designed by one of the founder, at the point where someone else's business comes in interference with yours it becomes your business and that is the self healing part of our function here and why this principle won't backfire the way you think it would, according to this principle, higher level of incarceration of blacks in america, is wholly there business and can't be swept under the rug, therefore without ever working for equality, minding your business even if sounding like the opposite of it, accomplishes the aim and doesn't miss the mark. On this particular respect I will just add that Kanye West is right and that to abolish slavery we'd need to reppeal the 14th amendment, this can be figured by the wording on said amendment, by careful reading and interpretation you will be able to discern that it is in fact one of the leading causes of the enslavement of blacks in prison. 

I'll leave on that because I think I covered enough ground even thought there might still be some ground to cover, have a great day, much love from the internet ! <3 

#If equality is applied to opposite ends of this positive energy function, which is fueled by difference deltas, the difference deltas collapse to 0, as well as the positive energy
