When I was younguer I always use to compare price as a way to relativize things to people,

this was erased and so I am rewriting it.
The idea is to have an app with benevolent action posted on it, a little bit like facebook wall.
This would be a platform to link people willing to pickup trash with people willing to pay for their neiborhood to get cleaned up.
The idea is that someone benvolent can go and pick up some trash, then takes a picture and post it on the app with the location of the pickup
then a notification could be sent to people living nearby to invite them to pay for the service. In this way we create a new opportunity to accomplish a task 
that needs to be done but that no-one is gonna simply do. That way the person has to be benvolent because he or she has to work without pay at first and then if 
people are encouraging than the person gets paid the full amount of the contribution. No platform cut, the way the platform gets funding is the same people who use it
can encourage it by giving money. Anyhow this would look like a classic social media but this time linking benevolent action to people who want to use their money in a 
benevolent way.
