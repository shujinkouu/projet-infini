A computer seems magic, like a magic rectangle if we are talking about your phone for example
let's say we are talking about a desktop compuer as a general idea for a cmmputer
what I will discus if fully applicable for any computer, from cellphone
to high tech servers the basic concept still holds 

baswically you have different componant which communiate using electricity throught a motherboard
the motherboard is like the frame for your bike you build evertyhing upon it and it jons all the parts 
together and "makes them work" 

so plugged on the motherboard is different composant

memory:
hard drive
ssd
random access memory

data processing:
processor
graphical processor

let's say you'd want to build a desktop computer you would have to buy these parts:

power supply -> power source
processor ->data processing
motherboard -> frame
graphics card -> data processing
ram -> memory
harddrive and or ssd -> memory

and a case which is optional but it is always nice to have

the power supply gets plugged into the wall and will convert that sweet what power into the different circuit you'll need for your computer
the frame or the motherboard is there so that all the component can talk to each other

let's skip all the starting process

once started the grphical processor output the frames you see the processor takes care of the different things you want to do that is for the data processing part

let's pretend you are already smart enough to be running your os and your programs on an ssd and your importat files separate on an harddrive for sake of simplicity of explanation
so your os and programs get loaded directly from the memory of your ssd where if you click on a video file let's say it is loaded from your harddrive, those go and talk to your
processor throught the os to effectuates diverse activity like creating or deleting files for example. More complicated processes such as browsing the web use another type of memory
a temporary type of memory, the ram. All the page you currently have open in your browser are all saved internally in the ram, so that you don't have to load them perpetually
last steps for example in photoshop gets saved to the ram that's what allows you to go backward in operation by using ctrl+z, similar functions exist for your browser where
shift+ctrl+t opens up the last closed tabs for example. Ram gets deleted fully flushed every time you shutdown your computer, can't ctrl+z after a reboot!
