Explaning Computers: The Hardware

Many different composant are part of "hardware" every part as it's role and it's job, just as in a well oiled machine.
Those working together form what we call a computer, be it a desktop computer, a laptop or even a cellphone. Even atms some fridges and some tv as well as servers are formed with 
similar hardware composant forming what we can call a computer.

***Heatsink***
A cpu needs cooling to work properly, for that purpose one must use a heatsink and thermal paste or thermal grease. The thermal paste is a compound assuring good thermal
conductivity between your CPU and the heatsink. The CPU generates the heat by doing some math, the heat is transmitted to a heatsink with the help of some thermal paste.
Once trapped in the heatsink the heat is dissipated using a fan.


***CPU - Processor***
A Cpu is a processor and does all the calculation done by your computer. It’s located in a socket of variant shape and sizes. Some example of socket are lga 1155, lga 1151, lga 1150, flga1136.
Sockets are a feature of both the motherboard and the cpu. So let's say I have a socket 1155 cpu I would need a socket 1155 motherboard.
CPUs work differently depending on the brand. Some example of manufacturer for these pieces of hardware inclue intel and amd but also samsung.

Two impotant part of a cpu is Cores and threads
they are really hard to discern from one another conceptually but are both important in the correct functionning of your cpu.
I think a core is the physical part that can do maths, multiple core is like you'd have multiple brains to do math simultaneously, or more accuratly multiple trains of thought
so core count limits the simultaneous trains of thought your computer can have, thread is virtual core so the same concept but not emulated in the physical world
sometimes you have a processor with 4 physical core but 8 thread or virtual core, meaning your processor can have 8 simultaneous trains of thought even if the physical limitation
seems to indicate a maximum of 4. The speed of those train of thoughts, the core speed, is represented in Ghz. The more Ghz the faster the train of thought complete. 
(Ghz is core speed it spellz Giga hertz and represent vibration or something)

the Core speed x the Core Count equals the theoretical performance.
However not all the CPUs are born equal, new ones are more optimized with new features and new architectures
Meaning similar core count and similar Ghz can be different in real world performance. But you can expect a similar result from similar Core count x Ghz

Good enough Standard:
For general purpose the new standard is 4 core with at least 2.5 Ghz core speed.
Anything that is that or better than that should be good enough for most things, except if your utilisation is Cpu intensive (your doing a lot of math).
some example of something requiring lots of math is 3d graphic work or database work, or more simply, gaming.


***GPU - Graphical Processor***
For this we need some explanation of how images and movement or the illusion of movement work with decompose movements in multiple consecutive frames that give the impression to the
eyes and intern to the brain that movement is occuring a gpu process those individual frames for displaying them to the user.
A graphic card serves as a unit responsible to display an image on your monitor. A graphic card is a bridge between a gpu, some GRAM (which is graphic ram) and a ton of controller,
capacitor and other stuff… that’s the end of my current knowledge on Gpu (this is the good enough edition after all). All you need to know is: a Graphic card display the image on
your screen, combining the power of a gpu (graphic processing unit) some GDDR Ram as well as other ‘stuff’. Renders the frames you see.


***RAM - Random Access Memory***
Ram is virtual Memory it works like regular memory (More on that in HDD/SSD) but disappears when you shut the computer, it’s memory used for process.
If you use photoshop for example the more ram your Computer has the more moves you can keep in memory (in the RAM), ctrl-z keeps old moves in memory and rolls them back when you
press the command this is directly powered by your ram, if you turn your computer on and off every ctrl+z move does nothing because the ram has been wiped the more ram the more
you could save moves in ctrl-z like in photoshop there is an option to save the last 250 moves but for that you'd need lots of ram, naturally.
Ram is used by all computer process from just your os (Operating System) being open to Multiple Programs on top of you os. 

The more the better ?
No, all you need is enough for what you use. Some process require WAY more RAM then others, like rendering. Usually 8Gb is the standard for normal usage, if you multitask
and use multiple programs at once or simply do some video editing whilst listening to the youtube, you’ll need 16 Gb if you’re a tab fiend 
(So you never close anything programs or tabs) or if you do a lot of multitasking you’ll need 32 Gb. Basically you’ll start experiencing discomfort due to Ram being
full at aprox. 80% of your total Ram being in use. So if you have 16Gb your max usage will be 12.8 Gb. The max ram you can have is Motherboard specific so check that on
your Motherboard manual online or elsewhere, for that you’ll need the motherboard serial number which you can find in system info on your computer.
So what about DDR3 vs DDR4 ? 
DDR3 is current Good enough and the New shiny thing is DDR4, those are both RAM architecture and are Motherboard specific. Ram also has speed but this has been shown many
times as having little impact on actual performance. Ram speed is in Mhz.

Good enough Standard:
For general purpose on windows 10 the new standard is 8gb, with less than that simply running the os is gonna create some lags, for anyone multitasking 16Gb is preferable
for tab fiends 32Gb is a must!

***Mobo - Motherboard***
A motherboard Acts like a bridge between the different parts of a computer, it’s what does the communication between everything.
The motherboard is the source of most failure and restrictions. Also the cause of most incompatibility.
Modern Motherboards are composed of DDR(3 or 4) slot, a CPU socket, Pci-e Slots, Pci-e minislot(e stands for express), PCI slot, Connector pins for power supply and fan headers.
as well as the I/o which is what you interact with as a user, usb ports, audio jack port ect. There's aso special plugs for the power button as well as other led and stuff you have.
The DDR slot is for the Ram it is motherboard specific
The CPU socket is for the CPU it is motherboard specific
Pci-e slots are for Graphic card mainly, as well as extension cards which serves the purpose of adding functionality to the Motherboard like Wifi capability, Audio Card or even USB 3.0 ports. 
PCI is for old expansion Cards .
Sata ports are for connecting HDD, SSD and optical drives 
All the pins are for your case options: Power on button, Reset Button, speaker, usb 2.0 and 3.0 port as well as any other option on your board.
The fan headers are for adding fans, 3 pins doesn’t allow for fan control and 4 pins does. The CPU fan must always be connected to the fan header called CPU_fan.


***PSU - Power Supply***
Every Component in your pc Use power, the two parts which use most power is your CPU and more then anything your GPU,
often you can find the Wattage rating you need on the GPU manufacturer Website under minimum power requirement.
Psu Rating is also an important concept, it starts at 80+ and goes to 80+ bronze, silver, gold and platinum rating respectively.
Those rating guarantee 80% of the max power as continuous power the max power is the one displayed in powersupply rating.
So let's say you buy a 600W power supply with a 80+ bronze rating for your computer this garantee 480W of continuous power, meaning that if you need 600W continuous power
you'll probably encounter problems and even system failure down the road because 600W rating means the max your power supply can provide is 600W but for a system that requires
600W it requires it as continuous garanteed power so you'd need 20% more as a max Watt rating with the 80+ label to garantee you get at least 80% of the advertised max Watts as 
continuous power.
Which means you’ll never dip below 80% of the Max Value advertised. So if you have a power supply advertised as being 500W and it has a 80+ guarantee this means you’ll never dip below 400W.
You want 80% of the max to be more than the minimum power requirement of you GPU (as written on the website), since the GPU is the most demanding part of your system you can often
use that as a heuristic.

A PSU has a lot of different cables,  here is a breakdown of the most often seen option:
1		4(+4) pin for the CPU 
1 or 2		6(+2) pin for the GPU
1		20(+4)pin for the motherboard
Molex connectors (which are 4 cables one yellow, black, black, red)
And Sata Cables (for ssd,hdd, and optical drive)

Molex Connectors have adapter which you can use to add fan outlet or even a 6 pin for your GPU 

Note: installation of psu cable is baby proof since the cables and port have a shape, just don’t force too much (max 6 Newton ^^).

***Case***
The computer case just hold the parts and add some feature like led and power buttons. One could have a computer running without a case see my computer running in a pizza box build guide.

***HDD/SDD - Harddrive / Solid State Drive***
HDD : a hard drive is what stores your data. It’s composed of a disc spinning and an arm that does the data reading. 
Buyer’s beware: there’s only two types of people those who have a backup and those who wish they had one before losing everything.
Data stored in the HDD can often still be recovered after it’s death since those data are stored on the physical disc inside (This is beyond the scope of this good enough guide tho).
HDD is slow memory it travels through a sata cable and is limited by it’s own spinning speed as well as the sata cable and port speed.
(but mostly limited to the speed of the disc spinning)

SSD : An SSD acts like an HDD in your pc, yet it’s 20 times faster. It doesn’t rely on a spinning disc and if a SSD breaks you lose the data since it was only stored on memory ship
similar to the ones you find in a usb stick as opposed to a spinning disc in the case of an hard drive. SSD cost a lot more by GB of storage.
SSD is fast Memory, only limited by the sata cable and port speed.
some ssd now use the m.2 architecture which enables you to use the pci-e port speed as opposed to the sata port speed providing even more speed.

Fast memory is used for OS and programs. 
Slow memory is used for documents and file which aren’t in use everyday.

The Good Enough Standard:
Fast Memory: depending on what you do often 250Gb is plenty
Slow Memory: depending on what you do often 1Tb is plenty
2 types of people those who have a backup and those who wish they had but then lost everything.

***Optical drive***
Optical Drives permit the use of CD and DVD sometimes blueray and can usually also burn copies.

***Peripherals***
Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor, Headset are called peripherals and aren’t part of the computer as itself but are used to interface with it.
