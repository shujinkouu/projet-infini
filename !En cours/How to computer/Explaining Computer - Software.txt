Explaining Computer Software

Software is what run on the physical device that is your computer (the hardware) everything you interact with as a user is part of software.

The are so many different layers of software.

The Bios
Bios of your motherboard, Asrock bios, Asus bios, ect..

Firmware
??? I don't actually have an example

Os:
IOS
Windows
Linux

Programs:
Google Chrome
Discord
Notepad
python
CMD


The bios and the firmware is the base it's the foundation it's one of the most simple yet one of the most complicated parts
most people have no idea how those two system work or interact, it is absolutely not necessary to understand how these works to make computers
the os is the default operating system and will enable you to control your hardware directly and is where you choose boot order and stuff like that.

The OS runs and is installed on your harddrive, this is Linux, Windows and the likes. This is your primary way, as a user, to interact with a computer.

On the OS you install the programs you love such as your browser and then on the browser you interact with the sites you visit such as Netflix, Facebook and the likes.

Programs can be anything from a browser or a simple calculator or again the most important software on your computer CMD which runs everything in the background, yet you never 
see it.
